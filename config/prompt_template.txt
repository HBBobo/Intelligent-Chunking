You are a semantic boundary scorer for document chunking.

Score the semantic boundary strength between each adjacent sentence pair.

## Scoring Scale (0-6, half-points allowed):

### Score 0 - Strong continuity (atomic unit)
Sentences complete each other's thought. One cannot stand alone.
Example: "The model uses gradient descent." → "It updates weights iteratively." = 0
Example: "Neural Networks." → "Neural networks are computational models." = 0 (heading + body)

### Score 1 - Very weak boundary (elaboration)
Second sentence adds detail, explains, or continues the same idea.
Example: "CNNs excel at image tasks." → "They detect edges, textures, and shapes." = 1

### Score 2 - Weak boundary (example/clarification)
Second sentence gives an example, minor aside, or clarification.
Example: "Many algorithms exist for clustering." → "K-means is popular for its simplicity." = 2

### Score 3 - Moderate shift (new angle, same subtopic)
Still the same subtopic, but a new angle or aspect within it.
Example: "Training took 3 hours on a GPU." → "The validation accuracy reached 94%." = 3
IMPORTANT: A paragraph break alone is NOT enough for 3. Use 1-2 if still elaborating.

### Score 4 - Strong boundary (new subtopic begins)
A new subtopic or conceptual block starts. A reader would expect a heading here.
Example: "...so that concludes gradient descent." → "Now consider regularization techniques." = 4
Example: "The model learns decision boundaries." → "Unsupervised Learning." = 4 (new section)

### Score 5 - Very strong boundary (major topic change)
Transition between major topics (e.g., supervised→unsupervised, methods→ethics, body→conclusion).
Example: "Reinforcement learning has shown great promise." → "However, ethical concerns remain." = 5
Example: "CNNs achieved remarkable success." → "Conclusion." = 5 (major section)

### Score 6 - Hard boundary (document/chapter level)
Only for document start, chapter breaks, or the FIRST section header.
Use 6 VERY sparingly - most major transitions are 4-5.

## CRITICAL RULES:

### Do NOT default to 3
- If unsure between 2 and 3, prefer 2.
- Score 3 requires a genuine aspect shift, not just a new sentence.
- A definition followed by elaboration = 0-1, NOT 3.

### Score distribution guidance
In a typical 50-100 sentence window:
- Most boundaries (60-70%) should be 0-2
- Moderate boundaries (20-30%) should be 3
- Strong boundaries (5-15%) should be 4-6
If you're assigning 3 to more than 40% of boundaries, reconsider.

### Two-step approach
1. FIRST: Identify the 3-6 strongest boundaries in the window (these are your 4-6 candidates)
2. THEN: Score all boundaries, ensuring top boundaries keep their high scores

### Low scores (0-2):
- Pronoun references ("It", "They", "This") = 0-1
- "For example", "Consider", "This means", "In other words" = 1
- Listing items, examples, or properties = 1-2
- Same paragraph, same idea = 0-1

### High scores (4-6):
- New learning paradigm (supervised→unsupervised→RL) = 5
- New model family (CNNs→RNNs→Transformers) = 4-5
- Transition to ethics, limitations, or conclusion = 5
- Heading → body text = 0 (header and its content form a unit)
- body text → new heading = 4-5 (entering new section)

## Sentences:
{numbered_sentences}

## Half-scores (use sparingly):
You may use .5 scores (e.g., 2.5, 3.5) ONLY when a boundary genuinely falls between two levels.
- Use 2.5 when it's more than an example (2) but not a full aspect shift (3)
- Use 3.5 when there's a clear shift but not quite a new subtopic (4)
Do NOT overuse half-scores. Most boundaries should be whole numbers.

## Task:
Output a JSON array of exactly {n_boundaries} numbers (0-6, half-points allowed).
Use the FULL range. Do NOT collapse everything to 3.
Output ONLY the JSON array, no explanation.
