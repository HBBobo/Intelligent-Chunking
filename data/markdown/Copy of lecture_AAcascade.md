How many take aspirin, ibuprofen, tylenol, naproxen?

Why???

# INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS

## PLASMA DERIVED
- COMPLEMENT CASCADE
C3a, C5a
- COAGULATION CASCADE
Thrombin, plasmin

## CELL-DERIVED
- VASOACTIVE AMINES
histamine, serotonin
- OXYGEN METABOLITES
hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)
superoxide anion (O₂⁻)
hypochlorous acid (HOCl⁻)
- ARACHIDONIC ACID METABOLITES
cyclooxygenase-derived
lipoxygenase-derived
- CYTOKINES
Interleukins Chemokines
Interferons Growth Factors
Tumor Necrosis Factor

# Intended Learning Outcomes To Understand The:

- Primary inflammatory mediators derived from the metabolism of arachidonic acid including their primary cellular source and biological activity.

- Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds on blocking the production of arachidonic acid metabolites during disease

- Mechanism of aspirin therapy and diets rich in fish containing high levels of omega 3 fatty acids as potentially important in lowering the incidence of cardiovascular disease.

# CELL SPECIFICITY OF ARACHIDONIC ACID-DERIVED PRODUCTS

|  CELL | PRODUCT  |
| --- | --- |
|  Neutrophils | Leukotrienes  |
|  Macrophage/Monocyte | Prostaglandins + Leukotrienes  |
|  Platelets | Thromboxane  |
|  Endothelial Cells | Prostacyclin  |

# In Vivo Effects of Arachidonic Acid Derived Products: Regulates

- Thermostatic Set Point (Fever)
- Pain (Interacts with pain receptors)
- Blood Flow
- Leukocyte Activity
- Platelet Function

# Biological Function of Arachidonic Acid Products

## Cyclooxygenase-derived Products:

**Prostaglandin E₂/Prostacyclin**
- Inhibits Immune cell activation
- Inhibits cytokine production
- Inhibits mast cell activation
- Blocks platelet aggregation
- Increases vasodilation

**Thromboxane**
- Causes vasoconstriction
- Induces platelet aggregation

# Biological Function

## Lipoxygenase-derived Products:

Leukotriene B₄
- Neutrophil Activation
- chemotaxis
- degranulation
- Mast cell activation
- degranulation

Leukotriene C,D,E (SRS-A)
- Smooth muscle contraction
- Increase vascular permeability

# Pharmacologic Regulation of Arachidonic Acid-Derived Products: Modulate

- Phospholipase activity:
- Suppress the release of arachidonic acid (no substrate available)
- Blocks both COX and LO-derived products

- Cyclooxygenase Activity:
- Blocks Cyclooxygenase-derived products
- COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors

- Specific enzymes down-stream from COX:
- Thromboxane synthetase inhibitors

- Lipoxygenase activity:
- Block 5-lipoxygenase enzyme
- Small molecule receptor antagonists for cysteinyl leukotrienes

# Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Compounds; NSAIDS

- Aspirin (acetysalicylic acid)
- Ibuprofen (propionic acid derivatives)
- Indomethacin (indole derivatives)
- Tylenol (acetominophen)
- COX-2 Inhibitors (Vioxx, celebrex, Bextra)

# COX-2 Inhibitors

- CELEBREX (Celecoxib) Pfizer-(Pharmacia)
- BEXTRA (Valdecoxib) Pfizer
- VIOXX (Rofecoxib) Merck

Osteoarthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Primary dysmenorrhea
Pain management

# Aspirin

- Irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase
- Acetylates active site of enzyme
- Decreased production of products (e.g. prostaglandins, prostacylcins &amp; thromboxanes)

# AN ASPIRIN A DAY

About 80 million aspirin tablets are consumed daily in the USA. Of those:

- 72% are taken for disease prevention
- 28% are taken for pain

# Aspirin Anti-thrombogenic Activity

- Inhibits platelet aggregation; blocks platelet-derived thromoboxane production
- Blocks platelet cyclooxygenase for the life of the platelet; no new protein synthesis
- Blocks endothelial cell-derived prostacyclin
- Suppression of endothelial cell-derived prostacyclin is short lived as endothelial cells can generation new cyclooxygenase enzyme
- Platelet activity is blocked more than endothelial cell activity
