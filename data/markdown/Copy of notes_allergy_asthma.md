- Type I Allergic Reactions
- Pathophysiology
- Primarily a Th2-type of disease
- ☐ Cytokines secreted increase production of IgE, IL-4, IL-13, IL-5
- ☐ Cytokines mature eosinophils and influence allergic responses
- Mediated by IgE binding to receptor on mast cells, basophils, activated eosinophils
- Degranulation when allergen binds to IgE to release mediators of early phase responses w/in mins
- ☐ Changes in vascular permeability
- ☐ Smooth muscle contraction
- ☐ Initiation of inflammation
- Late phase mediators result in release of more inflammatory mediators hours to days later
- ☐ Vascular permeability
- ☐ Smooth muscle contraction
- ☐ Increased inflammation
- ☐ Remodeling of connective tissue
- ☐ Matrix
- ☐ Mucus secretion
- Granules (mast cell) contain heparin, histamine, proteases, TNF-α, lipid mediators, cytokines, chemokines
- Eosinophils
- ☐ Bilobed nucleus
- ☐ Cytoplasm pink in eosin stain
- ☐ Production in bone marrow enhanced by IL-5
- ☐ Chemokines from Th2 cells chemotactic for eosinophils (presence is characteristic of chronic allergic inflammation)
- Basophils - Stain w/ basic dyes, degranulated when binding IgE

- Antigens and Allergens
- Allergens
- Tend to be small, particulate proteins inhaled or exposed in small quantities
- Can be used for benefits like vaccines or pathology of allergic responses
- Pollens, food proteins, pet dander, dried feces of dust mites
- Routes of exposure: airborne inhalation, contact, oral ingestion, medical injection
- Atopic Individuals do not become allergic to proteins in vaccines
- ☐ b/c these are encountered in different presentation, location, dose
- ☐ Recognized by immune system to stimulate T cell memory and ultimately host protection
- Atopy
- Genetically determined tendency to produce IgE mediated hypersensitivity rxns against innocuous substances
- Significant genetic component w/ several genes involved
- Genetics
- ☐ 60-70% inherited
- ☐ Concordance in twins
- ☐ Latest genome wide screen for genes contributing to asthma revealed ten different loci on different chromosomes
- ☐ 11q and 20p significantly associated w/ asthma even by most conservative tests
- ☐ Several genes whose products regulate Th2/Th1 balance or regulate expression of IgE

seem to contribute to atopic diseases (IL-4 receptor α for example)

- The "hygiene" hypothesis
- Observations that infants on farms tend to have less atopic disease than city dwellers or individuals from industrialized nations
- Infants exposed to certain antigens may be less likely to develop allergies
- Exposure to bacterial antigens critical to appropriate balance of Th1 and Th2 immune responses

- Clinical characteristics
- Part of body exposed will display symptoms often
- Response is usually in dose-dependent manner
- Uticaria = hives caused by skin contact

- Asthma
- Allergic response to breathed in allergen
- Result of mast cell degranulation --&gt; smooth muscle contraction
- Recurrence of such problems during late phase
- Increased secretion of mucus and fluids exacerbates problems in oxygen exchange

- Inflamed airway
- Vasodilated
- Smooth muscle contraction
- Thickened basement membrane
- Neutrophil, eosinophil, T-lymphocyte infiltration
- Excessive mucus secretion
- Airway wall edema
- Increased capillary permeability
- Shedding of damaged epithelial cells

- FEV1 changes
- Drop in 30 minutes
- Recovery
- Drop 8 hours later
- Slow recovery

- Immediate phase
- Result of mast cell degranulation
- Causes most of the acute symptoms of allergic rxn

- Late phase
- Due to chemokines, leukotrienes, cytokines synthesized by mast cells after IgE mediated activation by Th2 cells after restimulation by allergenic antigens
- In asthma, late phase is more detrimental b/c it results in permanent lung damage

- Anaphylaxis
- Some allergens in the blood stream can lead to degranulation of mast cells associated w/ blood vessels
- Cascade causes systemic smooth muscle constriction and vascular permeability (anaphylactic shock)
- Drug allergies, insect stings, and food can be associated w/ systemic anaphylactic shock
- Treatment relies on EPI and medicines to restore normal cardiac and respiratory systems

- Treatment
- Avoidance
- Pharmacologic
- Treatment of Symptoms
- Antihistamines
- Nasal corticosteroids
- Decongestants
- β-agonists
- Immunotherapy
- Desensitization by injection of allergens in form that changes nature or intensity of

immunity response
- Inducing tolerance or shifting production of antibodies away from IgE
- Usually used w/ aeroallergens and drugs, not foods
