# Type I Diabetes

Tuesday, February 19, 2008
9:00 AM

- Diabetes Mellitus: systemic disease with multiple metabolic abnormalities, mainly elevation in plasma glucose (lipid metabolism, ketones)
- Classification
- Type I
- A. Immune Mediated - 85%
- B. Idiopathic - 15%
- Type II
- Other types (MODY, secondary DM)
- Signs of Type I: Polyuria; Polydipsia (thirst); Polyphagia (hunger); weight loss; fatigue; increased frequency of infections; rapid onset (type II is much slower progressing); insulin dependent; early onset
- Differences between type I and II: type I has islet cell antibodies and patients are typically thin
- HLA related genetic background, no insulin secretion, non-insulin resistant, non-responsive to oral meds, ketosis prone
- Type I is only 5% (1.5-2mm cases)
- Type I is chronic autoimmune disease but can also develop in adults/elderly
- Polygenic: HLA linkage, non-MHC genes
- Autoimmune etiology: antibodies to islet autoantigens, autoreactive T cells
- Immune modulation alters course: antigen vaccination, general immunosuppression
- Graph on pg. 297
- Will see multiple antibodies during beta cell injury phase
- Declining beta cell mass
- Loss of first phase insulin response (pre-diabetes)
- Diabetes full blown once mass is below 10%
- Type I
- Insulin resistance
- β cell hypertrophy
- Islet inflammation, pathogenic T cells, β cell decomposition
- Impaired glucose tolerance
- Autoimmune diabetes, insulitis, β cell death
- Genetic Links
- Lifetime empiric risk increases w/ close relatives
- Father has greater effect than mother --&gt; imprinting
- HLA class II genes have highest incidence
- HLA complex: (DQ2, DQ8), DR3, DR4 are most associated w/ Type I
- Sibling sharing 2 HLA haplotypes w/ type I affected sibling at much higher risk of developing
- Multiple factors
- Autoreactive T cells --&gt; islet autoantibodies (not shown to directly kill β cells)
- Elevated cytokines (IFNγ, IL-1β, TNFα, etc.)
- Increased apoptosis/necrosis, decreased neogenesis
- Hyperglycemia --&gt; glucose toxicity
- Environmental Factors
- All combine to lead to β cell death
- Environmental factors
- Congential rubella syndrome - similar antigens to those in Type I DM --&gt; immune response
- Cocksakie B virus?
- Enterovirus?
- Streptozotocine (low doses)?
- Loss of self tolerance to self-antigens

Insulin - main antigen in T1DM
GAD65
ICA512/IA-2
$\bigcirc$  Znt8 - 60% of Type I
Can be one or multiple antigens

Starts w/ insulin --&gt; epitope spreading to GAD, Znt8, IA2

Theory is that not enough insulin enters thymus during T cell development --&gt; recognition as non-self

T Cells

Cell-mediated immunity

CD4
CD8
NK cells?
M'phages?
Dendritic cells?

Normal individuals have balance btwn pathogenic and regulatory T cells

T1D prone express too much pathogenic/too little regulatory
T1D protected are reverse

XLAAD

FOXP3 stop codon
- Genetic defect can lead to type 1 diabetes in presence of other autoimmune disorders for abnormalities in regulatory T cell maturation
Tregs may play role in suppressing possible autoimmune disorders

Cytokines: CD4 T cells

IL-12 --&gt; Th1 --&gt; IFN-γ, IL-2 --&gt; cell-mediated immunity, autoimmunity, pro-inflammation, allograft rejection
IL-10 + IFN-α --&gt; Tr1 --&gt; IL-10 + TGF-b --&gt; suppression/regulation
IL-4 --&gt; Th2 --&gt; IL-4/5 --&gt; humoral immunity/anti-inflammatory
IL-  $\beta$  IFN-y, TNF-  $\alpha$  -oxidative stress  $- &gt; 0$  NO production  $- &gt; 0$  cell death

- Role of Autoantibodies

Markers of disease
GAD65, IA-2, Insulin, Islet cell
Assays

Immunoprecipitation for GAD-65, IA-2 antibodies
Radioimmunoassay for insulin antibodies
Immunoperoxidase staining for islet cell antibodies

More antibodies -- increases probability of developing type II

Conclusions

Type I DM is a polygenic disease w/ HLA DR3, DR4 having the strongest effect
CD4 and 8 T cell responses to islet autoantigens are pathogenic
Defect of Reg T cells in suppressing pathogenic autoimmune responses is assoc w/ Type I DM
Proinflammatory cytokines IL-  $\beta$  IFN-y, TNF-  $\alpha$  can cause  $\beta$  cell death
Gene defects in FOXP3 and AIRE cause multiple autoimmune diseases incl. T1DM
Presence of antibodies to insulin, GAD-65, IA-2 are high risk markers of T1D progression
