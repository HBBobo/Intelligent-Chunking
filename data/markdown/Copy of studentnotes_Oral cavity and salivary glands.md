# Oral Cavity &amp; Salivary Glands

# Layers of the GI Tract

1. Mucosa (mucous membrane)
epithelium
lamina propria
muscularis mucosa
i. Lining Mucosa: lip, cheek, floor of mouth, soft palate, ventral surface of tongue
ii. Masticatory Mucosa: gingiva, hard palate
1) Epithelium - keratinized or parakeratinized
2) Submucosa - absent
iii. Specialized Mucosa: dorsal surface of tongue
1) Filiform Papillae – keratinized epithelium
2) Fungi form Papillae - non-keratinized epithelium
3) (Foliate Papillae) - rudimentary in human
4) Circumvallate Papillae – non-keratinized epithelium with associated taste buds and von Ebner’s salivary glands

2. Submucosa

3. Muscularis Externa
inner-circular
outer-longitudinal
(3RD layer in stomach)

4. Serosa or adventitia
Glands
- Glands within the GI Tract
- Glands outside - Salivary glands, Liver, Pancreas
Epithelium - non-keratinized
Submucosa contains salivary glands

- Oral Mucosa
o Lip
- Outer lip: skin, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands
- Vermillion border
- Capillaries close to surface, dilated --&gt; red
- No salivary glands
- Oral mucosa: squamous non-keratinized epithelium, labial salivary glands in submucosa
- Lamina propria under mucosa
- Labial salivary glands
o Masticatory Mucosa
- Stratified keratinized squamous epithelium on roof of mouth and gums
- Respiratory epithelium above it (nasal cavity)
- Bone in hard palate
- Tooth
o Specialized Mucosa
- Dorsal and lateral borders of tongue covered by mucous membrane
- Dorsal surface has papillae
- Bundles of skeletal muscle crossing at right angles
- Dense lamina propria
- Filiform papillae - conical, core of lamina propria, keratinized epithelium
- Fungiform papillae - expanded, smooth, round tops
- Circumvallate papillae - large circular, deep trench, non-keratinized epithelium

☐ Taste buds on lateral borders
☐ Non-myelinated nerves
☐ Serous glands of von Ebner in lamina propria drain into base of trench

- Gingiva and Teeth
- Muco-gingival junction: parakeratinized (keratin w/ cells)
- Gingiva
- Highly keratinized and underlying CT that surrounds the teeth
- Interdigitation w/ lamina propria increases surface area for epithelial attachment to CT
- Tooth
- Enamel is removed because it is decalficied, 95% mineral
- Dentin: 65% mineral, appears as acellular fibers
- Cementum: between dentin and periodontal ligament
- Periodontal ligaments bind alveolar bone to tooth dentin, Sharpey's fibers, extensive vascular supply
- Cemento-enamel junction
- Acellular cementum toward root apex
- Cellular cementum can be differentiated by presence of cementocytes w/in lacunae
- Bone appears as longitudinally oriented in alveolar socket; appears like immature or woven bone w/ no Haversian systems
- Dentinal tubules in dentin w/ odontoblasts lining pulp cavity
- Ameloblasts in enamel
- Gingival attachment
- Epithelial attachment to enamel can break down leading to infection
- Results in loss of alveolar bone, periodontal ligament and eventually the tooth
- Pulp is inside of teeth

- Salivary Glands
- General structure
- Gland has lobules
- Divided by stromal tissue where blood vessels, nerves and large, interlobular ducts are
- Interlobular ducts have pseudostratified columnar epithelium
- Secretory acinar cells and ducts w/in each lobule
- Parotid (23% of saliva production)
- Abundance of fat
- Acinar cells fairly uniform in appearance because secretions are serous
- Intralobular ducts made of simple columnar epithelium
- Striated ducts transport water and ions
- Intercalated ducts connect secretory acini and striated ducts
- Submandibular (65%) and sublingual (4%)
- Mix of serous and mucous secretory cells
- Mucous secretory cells stain lightly, nuclei pushed against basal cell membrane
- Serous demilune cells at cap of region are brightly stained; fixation artifact because serious and mucous cells adjacent
- Intercalated ducts too short to be seen in section
- Sublingual has more mucous acini and fewer intralobular ducts --&gt; stains lighter overall
