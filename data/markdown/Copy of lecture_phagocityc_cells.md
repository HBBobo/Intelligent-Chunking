# Phagocytic Cells: Mechanisms of Bacterial Killing and Tissue Injury

- Learning Outcomes:
- To understand the pathophysiologic role of phagocytic cells in host defense.
- To understand the role of reactive oxygen metabolites and lysosomal granules in phagocytic cell function

# Phagocytic Cells

- Peripheral Blood Leukocytes (nrml. 4.5-11,000cells/ul)
- Lymphocytes (~ 30%)
- Granulocytes (~ 70%)
- Granulocytes:
- Neutrophils (~ 60% of total leukocytes in blood)
- Eosinophils (~ 3%)
- Basophils (&lt;1%, rare)
- Monocytes (~ 6%)
- Monocytes → Macrophages (tissues)
- Kupffer cells (lining liver sinusoids)

- Kill bacteria and other microbes
- Degrade necrotic tissue and foreign antigens

- Tissue damage during prolonged inflammation

# Phagocytic Cell Functional Responses

- Adhesion (localization)
- Chemotaxis (migration)
- Phagocytosis
- NADPH oxidase activation
- Lysosomal granule fusion: degranulation

# Opsonization and Phagocytosis

- Protein recognized by phagocytic cell binds to bacteria surface
- Enhances phagocytosis
- Antibody $\longleftrightarrow$ Fc receptors: IgG, IgM $\longleftrightarrow$
- Complement $\longleftrightarrow$ C3b receptors
- Mannose binding protein MBP receptors

# Reactive Oxygen Metabolites

Superoxide anion: O₂-
O₂ + e⁻ → O₂-
Hydrogen peroxide: H₂O₂
2O₂⁻ + 2H⁺ → H₂O₂ + O₂
Hydroxyl radical: OH.
H₂O₂ + Fe²⁺ → OH⁺ + OH⁻ + Fe³⁺
Hypochlorous acid: HOCl
H₂O₂ → HOCl + OH⁻
myeloperoxidase = MPO

Chronic Granulomatous Disease of Childhood (CGD): deficiency of NADPH Oxidase

# Nitric Oxide (NO) Synthase

L-arginine → NO → hydroxyl
radical
peroxynitrites

- Endothelial cell
- Macrophages (inducible): intracellular cytotoxic agent
- Nervous system

# Oxidant Targets

a) unsaturated lipids: lipid peroxidation
LOOH = lipid hydroperoxides

c) proteins
- sulfhydryl groups
- methionine
- tyrosine

d) nucleic acids

# Degranulation

- Bactericidal proteins (e.g. defensins)
- Proteases
- serine proteases (e.g. elastase)
- metalloproteinases (e.g. collagenase, gelatinase)
- Acid hydrolases

# Protective Mechanisms

Anti-oxidant: specific vs. non-specific

## Specific enzymes:

Superoxide dismutase: 2O2- + 2H+  →  H2O2 + O2

Catalase: 2H2O2  →  2H2O + O2

Glutathione peroxidase: H2O2 + 2GSH  →  2H2O + GSSG

LOOH + 2GSH  →  H2O + LOH + GSSG

LOOH = lipid hydroperoxides
GSH = reduced glutathione
GSSG = oxidized glutathione

Non-specific scavengers:

-Vitamin E
-Vitamin C
-Beta-carotene

# Anti-proteases

- α-1- anti-protease (anti-trypsin):
- plasma protein
- binds proteases including elastase
- inactivated by oxidants
- α-2- macroglobulin
- plasma protein
- binds proteases
- TIMPs: tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
- cell derived

# Synergism: Inactivation of alpha-1-anti-trypsin

## 1. HOCl Dependent

## 2. Metalloproteinase Dependent

# Case: A 3 year old boy is brought to the emergency department

- CC: a productive cough, fever (temp 102.1 C), and headache.
- PEx: healthy boy with rales present on auscultation of the left lower chest.
- CxR: intra-alveolar infiltrate in the left lower lobe.
- Hx: mother reports multiple episodes (approx. 5 per year) of recurrent bacterial infections including otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, and purulent skin lesions. These infections usually responded to antibiotic treatment.

List three different mechanisms that could account for this patient's increased susceptibility to bacterial infection:

1.
2.
3.

# Mechanisms Associated with Increased Susceptibility to Bacterial Infection:

1. Lack of neutrophils: leukopenia
2. Defective neutrophil function
- Adhesion / migration
- Phagocytosis
- Bacterial killing
3. Lack of chemoattractants: deficiency
4. Lack of opsoninization of bacteria
- antibody deficiency / complement def.
