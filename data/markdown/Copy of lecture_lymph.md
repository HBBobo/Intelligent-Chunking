# Learning Objectives

Text: Ross, 5th ed., pp. 396-441
Atlas: Wheater’s, 5th ed., pp. 215-233

1. Understand the distinction between PRIMARY and SECONDARY lymphoid organs

2. Be able to describe the **organization** and **function of**:
- Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
- **Diffuse** and **nodular** lymphoid tissue, also including regions of extensive lymphoid infiltration such as Peyer’s patches, appendix, and tonsils.
- **lymph nodes**
- **Spleen**
- **Thymus**

3. Be able to identify the regions rich in B and T lymphocytes in each organ and explain the cellular processes, relevant to immune functions, that are taking place in these regions.

4. Know the homing patterns of B &amp; T lymphocytes.

# Functions of the Lymphatic System

1. Monitor body surfaces and fluid compartments (e.g. epidermis, mucosae*, interstitium)
2. React to the presence of potentially harmful antigens recognized as “non-self”
3. Autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, etc.)

Lymphatic System consists of:

A. Cells
1. Lymphocytes (B,T, natural killer)
2. Antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, Langerhans’ cells &amp; macrophages)

B. Lymphatic “tissue” – diffuse and nodular
C. Lymphatic “organs” (lymph nodes, spleen, thymus)
D. Lymphatic vessels that carry the cells and fluid

*Mucosae refers to lining tissue of the body cavities, e.g. GI tract, respiratory tract, genitourinary tract

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# Lymphoid organs are classified as:

## Primary lymphoid organs

- Thymus
- Bone marrow
- Lymphatic nodules of the distal intestinal tract (e.g. ileum and appendix)

## Secondary (effector) lymphoid organs/tissue

- Spleen &amp; lymph nodes (organs)
- Mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), e.g. lymphocytes and lymphatic nodules in the lamina propria

PD-ENZL

Ross, Fig. 14.1

# Primary Lymphoid Organs:

The bone marrow and the thymus and the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (e.g. appendix, terminal ileum) are the initial "education centers" of the immune system

In these organs, lymphocytes (T cells in the thymus, B cells in bone marrow and gut) differentiate into immunocompetent cells (i.e. they can recognize "self" vs. "nonself")

This differentiation is said to be antigen-independent

The lymphocytes then enter the blood and lymph to populate:
- epidermis and mucosae
- connective tissue
- secondary lymphoid organs

# Secondary Lymphoid Organs:

The lymph nodes, lymphatic nodules, tonsils, spleen are the secondary “education centers” of the immune system

In these organs, immunocompetent lymphocytes differentiate into immune effector and memory cells that undergo antigen-dependent activation and proliferation in these organs.

These lymphocytes then carry out their functions in the:
- connective tissue
- secondary lymphoid organs
- mucosal surfaces lining epithelia

They participate in:
- Cell mediated immunity (mostly “cytotoxic” T cells)
- Humoral responses (production of antibody) (B cells, also requires “helper” T cells.

# Lymphocytes in peripheral blood smear

These are B and T-cells that have undergone antigen-INDEPENDENT differentiation and are trafficking through the bloodstream on their way to lymphoid organs/tissue.

The palatine tonsils are paired structures made of dense accumulations of lymphatic tissue located in the mucous membrane of the junction of the oropharynx and oral cavity. The tonsils dip down into the underlying CT, forming crypts. There are also lingual tonsils and pharyngeal tonsils (under the roof of the nasopharynx and around the opening of the Eustachian tubes). Key features: crypts, abundant nodules, stratified squamous epithelium

# Lymph Nodes

Main functions:

1. Filter lymph, thereby promoting lymphocyte contact with antigen
2. Provides necessary microenvironment for antigen-dependent differentiation

Ross, Fig. 14.1

Lymphoid circulation in the body takes place in both the blood stream and the lymphatic vessels, a separate vessel system that carries cells of the lymphoid system and their products (cytokines, antibodies, etc.).

# Lymphatic Circulation Through a Lymph Node

## Lymph nodes filter lymph

1. Afferent lymphatic vessels drain lymph into the **Subcapsular Sinus**
2. Lymph then passes to the **Trabecular sinuses**
3. From there, the lymph goes to the **Medullary sinuses.**
4. Lymphocytes and macrophages pass easily between these sinuses and the tissue of the lymph node.
5. Macrophages in sinuses monitor the fluids. Macs phagocytose the antigenic material and present it to T- and B-cells

# Lymph Node Structure

- Capsule &amp; subcapsular sinus
- Trabeculae &amp; trabecular sinuses
sinuses contain lymph, macrophages, and reticular cells

- Cortex:
- superficial cortex (B-cells)
- primary follicles/nodules
- secondary follicles/nodules
(i.e. with germinal centers)
- “deep” cortex (T-cells, dendritic cells)

- Medulla:
- medullary cords (B-cells, plasma cells)
- medullary sinuses (lymph, more macrophages, plasma cells, and reticular cells)

# Summary of lymphocyte traffic in a lymph node

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

- Solvent drag caused by HEV fluid transport draws lymph in via afferent vessels
- ~10% of lymphocytes enter this way; mostly memory cells
- HEV endothelial cells express selectins and other receptors for antigen-primed lymphocytes that stimulate them to EXIT bloodstream via diapedesis
- ~90% enter this way; mostly naïve lymphocytes
- T-cells move to deep cortex; B-cells migrate to superficial cortex; differentiated plasma cells move to medullary cords and secrete IgG into lymph
- Lymphocytes may leave lymph node via EFFERENT lymph vessels (can rejoin bloodstream via thoracic duct, jugular vein, etc.)

PD-1REL

Ross, 14.29

# Splenic Circulation

1. Blood enters via splenic artery at hilus
2. Splenic artery branches into trabecular arteries (which travel within connective tissue trabeculae).
3. Trabecular arteries give off branches known as central arteries which leave the trabecula and enter the substance of the spleen (covered by a peri-arterial lymphatic sheath).
4. Central arteries branch into penicillar arterioles that piece through the lymphatic sheath and spill into splenic cords.
5. Blood percolates through splenic cords and across walls of splenic sinuses.
6. Splenic sinuses drain into pulp veins.
7. Pulp veins drain into trabecular veins.
8. Trabecular veins drain into splenic vein at the hilus.

Circulation in the human spleen is primarily "OPEN:" blood pours into the red pulp, percolates through red pulp cords, and re-enters the bloodstream at splenic sinuses

NOTE: NO afferent lymph vessels –not necessary because lymphocytes can easily enter splenic parenchyma via “open” circulation pattern.

Develops from an invagination of EPITHELIUM of the 3rd pharyngeal pouch, so an endodermal organ.

Specialized epithelial cells (called epithioreticular cells) that are joined to one another by long processes with desmosomes on the extremities of the cells (like starfish joined together at the tips) make up the bag-like support for:

Lymphocytes that, when the organ is young, fill this “bag”.

# Overview of T-cell “education”

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

1. Naïve T-cells enter medulla via diapedesis across venules
2. Pass into cortex to undergo POSITIVE selection:
- Presented with MHC molecules and self or non-self antigens by ERCs
- T-cells that recognize MHCs and self/non-self antigens “pass” this selection process and survive (those that don’t undergo apoptosis)
3. Move into medulla to undergo NEGATIVE selection:
- T-cells that recognize SELF antigens displayed by self MHCs (i.e. are :autoreactive”) are eliminated
4. Differentiate into helper (CD4+) or cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells and leave medulla via diapedesis across venules

# Blood-Thymus Barrier

Education of T-cells must occur in a very controlled environment such that antigens are ONLY presented by epithelial reticular cells.

To ensure that no other cells or free antigens are present, there is a very tight BLOOD-THYMUS BARRIER consisting of:

1. The blood capillary wall
- endothelial cells
- endothelial cell basal laminae
- pericytes

2. Perivascular connective tissue
- type III collagen
- macrophages

3. Epithelioreticular cell layer
- basal lamina of the epithelial reticular cells (type I ERCs)
- epithelial reticular cells

(NOTE: T-cells can enter thymus ONLY via bloodstream – NO AFFERENT LYMPH VESSELS!)
