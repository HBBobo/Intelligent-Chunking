# GASTRIN-CCK FAMILY

1. Gastrin
2. Cholecystokinin (CCK)

# GASTRIN

## Major Physiological Effects:

1. Gastric Acid Secretion
2. Gastric Mucosal Growth

## Chemistry

G-4 minimal active fragment shared with CCK
G-5 Pentagastrin (synthetic)
G-17 "little" gastrin → Exist as both non-sulfated
G-34 "big" gastrin → and sulfated forms

## Secretion

1. Synthesized by G cells in gastric antrum
2. Released in response to food in stomach

# CHOLECYSTOKININ (CCK)

## Major Physiological Effects:

1. Gallbladder Contraction
2. Pancreatic Enzyme Secretion
3. Inhibition of Gastric Emptying

## Chemistry:

CCK-8
CCK-33
CCK-58
&gt; All contain sulfated tyrosine

## Secretion:

1. Synthesized by I cells in duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa
2. Released in response to peptides and fatty acids in lumen of small intestine

# Secretin-GIP-VIP-Glucagon Family

1. SECRETIN
2. GASTRIC INHIBITORY PEPTIDE (GIP)
3. GLUCAGON
4. VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL PEPTIDE (VIP)

# Secretin-GIP-VIP-Glucagon Family

# SECRETIN

## Major Physiological Effects:

1. Stimulation of Bile and Pancreatic $\mathrm{HCO}_3$ Secretion
2. Inhibition of Gastric Acid Secretion

## Chemistry:

27 aa peptide

## Secretion:

Secretin is synthesized by S cells in the duodenal mucosa and released in response to acid (pH &lt; 4.5) in the duodenal lumen

# GASTRIC INHIBITORY PEPTIDE (GIP)

## Major Physiological Effects:

1. Stimulation of Insulin Secretion
2. Inhibition of Gastric Acid Secretion

## Secretion

Synthesized and released from a distinct type of duodenal endocrine cell in response to luminal nutrients

# GLUCAGON

Found in both pancreas and gut but processed in islets to glucagon and in gut to GLP-1 and GLP-2

# VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL PEPTIDE (VIP)

Widely distributed neuropeptide most often inhibitory to muscle but stimulates glandular secretion.
Tumors (VIPomas) result in secretory diarrhea

# Other GI Regulatory Molecules

Histamine – paracrine regulator; major stimulant of gastric acid secretion

Bombesin or GRP (Gastrin Releasing Peptide) – neuropeptide; stimulates gastrin release

Motilin – intestinal GI hormone; regulates intestinal motility (MMC)

Enkephalins – neurocrine regulators of motility and secretion

Substance P – neuropeptide; usually excitatory

Somatostatin – universal inhibitory paracrine or endocrine regulatory peptide

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) – formed by postranslational processing of proglucagon in intestine. An important regulator of insulin secretion and appetite

GLP-2 (glucagon-like peptide 2) – stimulates growth of intestinal mucosa

Inflammatory Mediators – Serotonin, cytokines, chemokines

Growth and Trophic Factors – Insulin, TGF $\alpha$, IGF

Ghrelin – oriexigenic peptide present in the gastric mucosa
