# Neuropharmacology II

## Antidepressants and Sedatives

## Depression

- A frequent problem, affecting up to 5% of the population
- Common presentations include low mood, loss of energy, disinterest in activities
- May also include weight loss, sleep disturbance, or psychosis
- Should be considered in patients with atypical dementia and chronic pain

## Diagnosis of Depression - DSM-IV

- Five of the following present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning:
- depressed mood
- markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities
- significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain
- insomnia or hypersomnia
- psychomotor agitation or retardation
- fatigue or loss of energy
- feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
- diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness
- recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt

- The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).
- The symptoms are not better accounted for by Bereavement

## Pathophysiology of depression

- At present, mechanism is unknown - may be more than one mechanism.
- No useful biomarkers or imaging abnormality during life
- Study of postmortem brain has not revealed any consistent structural or neurochemical abnormality
- Majority of the currently available medications were discovered empirically
- Most current theories are based on "amine hypothesis"

# Biogenic amines

## Dopamine

- Synthesis: tyrosine  $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{TH}}$  L-DOPA  $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{AADC}}$  dopamine
- Origin: substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area
- Targets: basal ganglia, cerebral cortex

## Norepinephrine

- Synthesis: dopamine  $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{D}\beta\mathrm{H}}$  Norepinephrine
- Origin: locus ceruleus
- Targets: cerebral cortex

## Serotonin

- Synthesis: tryptophan  $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{TPH}}$  5-HTP  $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{AADC}}$  serotonin
- Origin: raphe nuclei

# Classes of Antidepressants
- Tricyclics and heterocyclics
- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's)
- Bupropion
- Nonselective MAO inhibitors
- Non-pharmacological therapy
- ECT
- Psychotherapy

# Tricyclics and heterocyclics - Clinical pharmacology
- Large family of structurally related compounds
- Multiple pharmacological actions
- Therapeutic effect probably due to ability to block reuptake of serotonin and/or norepinephrine
- All may be sedating, although some much more than others
- Many of these drugs have anticholinergic (anti-muscarinic) actions - leads to somnolence, dry mouth, urinary retention

# Tricylics and heterocyclics - pharmacokinetics and toxicity
- All are primarily metabolized by the liver, and undergo first pass metabolism
- Biochemical half-lives range from 4 to more than 24 hours, but clinical response is much slower - typically several weeks of therapy is required to observe any clinical improvement
- Overdose of tricylics (more than 1 gram) is often lethal due to cardiac conduction disturbances. Great care must be taken when these drugs are prescribed for potentially suicidal patients.

# Some commonly used tricylics and heterocyclics
- Amitriptiline (Elavil®)
- Inhibits serotonin &amp; NE reuptake
- Prominent anticholinergic effects
- Metabolite is nortriptyline
- Desipramine (Norpramine®)
- Inhibits NE reuptake
- Mild anticholinergic effects
- Trazodone (Desyrel®)
- Heterocyclic
- Inhibits serotonin reuptake
- Minimal anticholinergic effects
- Sedating

# Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI's)
- Act by inhibition of presynaptic reuptake of serotonin in central synapses.
- Not as sedating as many of the tricylic compounds
- Also do not have the anticholinergic side effects of the tricyclics
- Some are potent inhibitors of P450 enzyme systems, and may lead to drug interactions

# Some commonly used SSRI's
- Fluoxetine (Prozac®)
- Sertaline (Zoloft®)
- Citalopam (Celexa®)
- Paroxetine (Paxil®)
- All are potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake
- Adverse effects: anxiety, tremor
- Overdose of SSRI alone is rarely lethal
- Should not be administered with nonselective MAO inhibitors
- Suicide as an adverse effect?

# Bupropion
- Structurally related to the tricyclics, but seems to have a different therapeutic mechanism, related to altered release of NE
- Not sedating or anticholinergic, but does sometime induce hallucinations or seizures
- Also effective in treating tobacco addiction

# MAO Inhibitors
- Non-selective, irreversible enzyme inhibitors - long duration of action
- Therapeutic effect is due to is enhancement of CNS amine levels
- Major adverse effects are due to excessive accumulation of amines in the circulation
- Tyramine: the "cheese effect."
- Drug interactions: SSRI's, sympathomimetics
- Safe in carefully controlled circumstances, but "real world" use may lead to serious adverse effects.

# Treatment of depression
- Many patients will not report symptoms of depression unless asked specifically
- Patients who are depressed may be suicidal - it is essential to inquiry about their intentions
- The response of an individual patient to a particular antidepressant cannot be predicted, and treatment often requires sequential trials of several drugs

- In severely depressed patients, ECT often produces a rapid improvement and may be the best initial treatment

## Sedatives and hypnotics

- Used to reduce anxiety, or induce sleep
- Very commonly prescribed
- Two principal chemical classes:
- Benzodiazepines
- Barbiturates
- Both work by enhancing activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA

## GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{CH}_2-\text{CH}_2-\text{CH}_2-\text{COOH} \\
| \\
\text{NH}_2
\end{array}
$$

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

- Principal inhibitory transmitter of the mammalian brain
- Receptors:
- GABA_A: ligand gated ion channels, regulate chloride ion, at least 15 different subunit proteins
- GABA_B: G-protein coupled receptors

## Effects of benzodiazepines and barbiturates on GABA Receptors

- Both drugs bind to $\mathrm{GABA_A}$ receptor subunits, but at different sites.
- Neither one binds to the agonist site
- Benzodiazepines increase the frequency of channel opening, but do not alter conductance or duration of opening
- Barbiturates prolong the duration of channel opening

## Benzodiazepines

- More than a dozen benzodiazepines are marketed in the US
- They are distinguished primarily by their profiles of distribution and half-life.

|  Examples of some benzodiazepines  |   |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | trade name | t1/2 - hours | typical application  |
|  midazolam | Versed | 1 - 3 | IV - brief sedation for procedure  |
|  triazolam | Halcion | 2 - 4 | hypnotic - may produce amnestic syndrome  |
|  temazepam | Restoril | 10 - 17 | hypnotic  |
|  lorazepam | Ativan | 10 - 20 | hypnotic, sedative  |
|  diazepam | Valium | 30 - 60 | hypnotic, sedative  |
|  flurazepam | Dalmane | 50 - 100 | old hypnotic - not recommended  |

- Toxicity is mainly excessive sedation.
- After chronic use, withdrawal seizures may occur, especially with short half-life agents
- Flumazenil: a benzodiazepine antagonist, blocks effects of other benzodiazepines

## Barbiturates

- Also distinguished largely by half-life and duration of action.
- Toxicity is excessive sedation, but unlike benzodiazepines, often leads to respiratory depression which may be fatal.
- Biochemical half lives range from 3 hours (methohexital) to 100 hours (phenobarbital)
- Redistribution is a key mechanism regulating duration of the biological effect of barbiturates (and benzodiazepines) when administered rapidly.

# Redistribution

- Redistribution is a mechanism which limits the duration of action

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

- Effect is greatest when:
- Agent is administered rapidly (e.g., intravenous)
- Agent is highly lipophilic
- Can lead to very short duration of action (minutes) even though biochemical half life is longer (hours).

# Clinical use of sedatives

- Anxiolytic use
- Usually a medium to long acting benzodiazepine, such as diazepam, administered orally.
- Hypnotic use
- Usually a short to medium acting benzodiazepine, such as temazepam, administered orally - but note that all hypnotics lose efficacy if taken daily.
- Sedative use (for surgical procedures)
- A short acting benzodiazepine, such as midazolam
- A short acting barbiturate, such as thiopental
- Administered intravenously, and action terminated by redistribution.

# Tolerance, cross-tolerance, and addiction

- Chronic use of sedatives of either class (benzodiazepine or barbiturate) induces tolerance to all members of the class, and cross-tolerance to members of the other class.

- Both also induce tolerance to ethanol, which acts in part through GABA receptors.
- Both benzodiazepines and barbiturates may produce dependence and are susceptible to abuse. Potentially lethal actions of the barbiturates makes them particularly problematic when abused.
- Rapid withdrawal from either class of sedatives may lead to anxiety, agitation, and seizures
