PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS

HST 071

# PRENATAL GENETIC DIAGNOSIS

## Indications for prenatal diagnosis

- Advanced maternal age
- Positive maternal serum alpha fetal protein
- Balanced maternal or paternal translocation
- Risk for detectable Mendelian disorder
- Family history of neural tube defects
- Abnormal fetal ultrasonography
- History of fetal wastage
- Parental concern

## Alpha Fetal Protein

- Glycoprotein MW 70,000 Dalton
- Produced by yolk sac and liver at 4-8 weeks
- Liver later becomes dominant source
- Most MSAFP gets to mother by diffusion
- Transmembranous transport from AF is 6%
- Any increase in production (twins) or increase in AF (NTD) leads to increase
- Expressed as multiples of the median (MOM) for given GA
- Maternal race, weight, multiple pregnancy, IDDM
- Each lab must establish norms and risks
- Diabetics have overall increased risk for anomalies
- AA have higher AFP at any given GA
- FH impacts risk as well
- Concentrated in very thin, diluted in very obese
- Elevated for α-fetal protein &amp; acetylcholinesterase
- MSAFP is also expressed as MoM for normal pregnancies of same gestational age
- Using 2.5 MoM we can detect 93-96% of open spina-bifida and 100% of anencephalics
- False positives are high (contamination of AF by fetal blood – especially if placenta is crossed by needle)
- AChE is so large that it is not in fetal urine. It will detect 99% of open spina-bifida

## Other causes of elevated AFP

- Abdominal wall defects
- Renal agenesis
- Fetal demise or impending demise
- Teratoma
- Congenital nephrosis
- Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
- Some maternal tumors
- IBD in mother
- Feto-maternal hemorrhage
- Oligohydramnios
- Fetal growth restriction

## Sonography

- All women had been encouraged to have amniocentesis if at risk in past years
- Modern sonography will detect virtually all lesions
- Gestational age errors, multiple gestation, fetal demise are all detectable
- Normal U/S allows 90% reduction in risk for NTD based on α-fetal protein
- Early genetic sonography is highly sensitive and statistically superior to later ultrasonography for Down syndrome detection.
- Early midtrimester sonography achieves a diagnostic accuracy similar to that currently reported for first-trimester nuchal translucency.

## Triple Screen

- A Fetal Protein (AFP)
- Human chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)
- Unconjugated estriol (μE3)
- Estimate risk of fetus with trisomy 18 and trisomy 21
- Low AFP, hCG and μE3 → trisomy 18
- Low AFP, μE3 and high hCG → trisomy 21
- Biologic basis for this unknown
- Three specific adjustments
- Maternal weight
- Obese women have lower MASAFP – dilution
- Diabetes Mellitus
- IDDM have AFP that is 2/3 that of non-diabetic
- Race
- AA women have AFP 9-15% higher
- Smoking ????
- Have lower incidence of trisomy 21 !!!!!

IN SUMMARY

# First Trimester Screening

- Now an option for pregnant women if certain criteria are met
- Nuchal translucency (NT), have allowed for earlier, noninvasive screening for chromosomal abnormalities and, when combined with serum screening in the first trimester, have comparable detection rates as standard second-trimester screening
- Low serum AFP (31% of trisomies)
- Free beta-hCG reduced in aneuploidy
- Schwangerschafts protein 1 (SP1) also known as pregnancy specific beta-1 glycoprotein - median for abnormal group (trisomy 18 and 21) is ½ that of normal group

# Quadruple Screen

- AFP, estriol, Hcg, Inhibin

# Inhibin in combination with alpha fetal protein

- The best three-analyte combination was maternal serum -fetoprotein, free -human chorionic gonadotropin, and dimeric inhibin A
- 97% of Down syndrome cases were detected at a false-positive rate of 16%.
- At a slightly higher false-positive rate (18%) maternal serum -fetoprotein, estriol, and intact human chorionic gonadotropin detected only 79% of cases.
- 67% (37/55) detection was obtained with use of the 2-analyte combination of a-fetoprotein and dimeric inhibin A

# Nuchal Translucency

- Higher rates of nuchal translucency screening were associated with lower rates of chorionic villus sampling and invasive testing.
- The addition of first-trimester screening may lead to reduced rates of invasive testing and fewer losses of normal pregnancies.
- The use of nuchal translucency adds to the sensitivity of detection but can add as much as $300,000 in cost for each detected Down’s syndrome baby.
- Increased nuchal skin alone, in the absence of other ultrasonographic dysmorphologic features, does not generally help to identify fetuses with other abnormal karyotypes.
- The nuchal thickness/humerus length ratio and maternal age had a 79.8% detection rate at a 22.1% false-positive rate, compared with maternal age plus humerus length (sensitivity, 55.1%) or maternal age plus nuchal thickness (sensitivity, 66.7%) at the same false-positive rate. For women &gt;35 years old the values were 80% and 22.0%, respectively.
- Nuchal thickness, humerus length, and maternal urine β-core fragment levels are another sensitive assay from Down’s syndrome
- Normal nuchal thickness in the midtrimester indicates reduced risk of Down syndrome in pregnancies with abnormal triple-screen results
- Midtrimester nuchal thickness measurement significantly detected postnatally confirmed CHD in chromosomally normal fetuses.

# PAPP

- First-trimester free-human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A screening for Down syndrome can achieve detection rates as high as those associated with alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin or alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol screening in the second trimester.
- Likelihood ratios for detection of various abnormalities with given tests

|  TEST | DOWN SYNDROME | UNAFFECTED  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  No test | 1.0 | 1.00  |
|  NT alone | 4.9 | 0.28  |
|  PAPP-A, fbhCG | 10.6 | 0.15  |
|  NT, PAPP-A, fbhCG | 36.1 | 0.08  |
|  AFP, uE3, hCG (triple test) | 8.4 | 0.13  |
|  AFP, uE3, hCG, INH-A (quad test) | 14.0 | 0.08  |
|  All 7 tests | 260.9 | 0.02  |

# Screening Strategies

- Triple screen: maternal age and midtrimester serum alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and unconjugated estriol
- Quad screen: triple screen plus serum dimeric inhibin A
- First trimester screen: maternal age, serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and free b-hCG and fetal nuchal translucency at 10 to 14 weeks' gestation
- Integrated screen: first-trimester screen plus quad screen, but first-trimester results are withheld until the quad screen is completed when a composite result is provided
- Sequential screen: first-trimester screen plus quad screen, but the first-trimester screen results are provided immediately and prenatal diagnosis offered if positive
- Combined first-trimester screening for fetal Down syndrome is more cost-effective than universal second-trimester triple serum screening.

# Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)

- 1991 – 5/289 pregnancies who had transabdominal CVS at 8 to 9.5 weeks
- Background incidence 5.42/10,000
- In a study of over 80,000 CVS the rate was 6.0/10,000
- Decreased perfusion, embolization
- Should be done at 9-12 weeks
- At least 200-250 yield "experience"
- Reserved for women "at risk"
- Fetal loss had been 1:200 (.5%)
- Age of 35 chosen
- Loss now considered to be 1:400 or even lower
- Maternal screening and u/s are so good that only those with abnormal findings need have amniocentesis
- Costs
- Pregnancy loss
- Transvaginal fluid leakage
- Bleeding
- Fetal trauma
- Difficulty in obtaining fluid
- Uterine contraction
- Membrane tenting
- Fetal movement and pocket obliteration
- Bloody fluid
- Mislabeling
