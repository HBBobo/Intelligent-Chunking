Classification of Immune Mediated Tissue Injury

Tuesday, February 19, 2008
10:00 AM

- Type I: Anaphylactic Type
- Allergen binding to mass cell to cause degranulation
- Prototype disorders
- Allergic rhinitis
- Asthma
- Anaphylaxis (insect venom)
- Immune mechanism
- IgE-Mast cell binding
- Vascular permeability
- Eosinophils
- Clinical
- Result of exposure to environmental allergens in genetically susceptible individuals
- Genetics not clearly defined, but association exists
- Atopy: genetic predisposition for developing IgE responses to many antigens
- Local or systemic symptoms
- Most common form - allergic rhinitis
- Certain types of asthma
- Atopic dermatitis (eczema)
- GI food allergies
- Allergens: pollens, molds, house dust mites, animal dander
- Pathophysiology
- Antigen presented by APC to Th cell --&gt; IL-4 activation of B cell
- IgE antibodies secreted by B cell
- IgE antibodies bind to Fc receptors on mast cells
- Antigen binds to IgE on mast cells
- Degranulation of mast cell releases cytokines
- IL-4,5,6 stimulates B cells
- IL-3,4 stimulates GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-8/0, inflammatory cell activation
- Mediators have variety of effects
- Increase vascular permeability
- Constrict airways
- Cell infiltration
- Asthma, eczema, hay fever
- Feedback effects on immune system
- Effects of mediators
- Histamine --&gt; vascular permeability, vasodilation of post-capillary venule, smooth muscle contraction
- Chemotactic factors
- Cytokines
- Lipid mediators
- Arachidonic acid metabolites: LTC4,D4,E4 --&gt; smooth muscle contraction; prostaglandins --&gt; vasodilation
- PAF - platelet activating factor
- Acetylated glycerol ether phophocholine --&gt; activates phagocytic cells, smooth muscle contraction
- Eosinophils
- Normal levels: 2 to 3% of total WBCs
- Type 1 response: up to 10%

Lecture Page 38

- Secretory products
- NADPH oxidase derived oxidants
- Prostaglandins and leukotrienes (LTC4)
- Major basic protein: cytotoxic
- Cytokines
- Others

- Symptoms depends on tgt organ
- Skin
- Gross: swelling, wheal and flare
- ♦ Early: preformed mediators
- ♦ Late: synthesized mediators
- LM: edema, eosinophils
- EM: edema, endothelial cell gaps
- Mucous and serous glands: increased secretion
- Bronchial and GI smooth muscle contraction

- Threapeutics
- Avoid antigen
- Mediator antagonists
- Anti-histamines: receptor antagonist
- Leukotriene inhibitors: lipase inhibitors, receptor antagonists
- Fxnl: sympathetic stimulatants (EPI)
- Inhibit mast cell degranulation: cromolyn
- Non-specific anti-inflammatory agents: corticosteroids
- Immunotherapy: "allergy shots"

- Diagnosis
- Skin tests: swell, wheal, flare (w/in mins) --&gt; Type I hypersensitivity
- RAST: bead w/ Ag + pt's serum + antihuman IgE --&gt; if fluorescent --&gt; allergic
- RIST: bead + anti-human IgE + serum --&gt; how much IgE

- Type II, Cytotoxic type
- Involves binding of IgG to tgt cell and cytotoxic action/complement activation
- Prototype disorders
- Hemolytic rxns
- Goodpastures syndrome
- Myasthenia gravis
- Grave's disease (hyperthyroidism)
- Immune Mechanisms
- IgG
- Complement
- Phagocytic cells
- ADCC
- Pathophysiology
- Binding of antibody w/ cell membrane or tissue antigens
- RBC membrane antigens - hemolytic anemias
- Mother is Rh-
- First baby is Rh+
- Mother develops anti-Rh+ IgG
- 2nd child is Rh+
- IgG crosses placenta
- Binds to RBC of fetus --&gt; hemolysis
- Treat by blocking sensitization of mother anti-D Ig w/in 72 hrs of first birth
- Platelet antigens - thrombocytopenia cell membrane - petechiae
- Basement membrane - goodpasture's syndrome (kidney, lung)
- Mechanisms
- Opsonin dependent phagocytosis

- Goodpasture's
- Hemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates, renal failure, anemia
- Pathology
- ☐ Circulating anti-GBM antibodies
- ☐ LM: n'phils, hemorrhage
- ☐ Immunofluorescence: Ig and complement deposition; linear
- ♦ Linear antigen deposition --&gt; Ab + complement deposition --&gt; linear secondary anti-human Ab to IgG or complement contain fluorescent marker
- ☐ EM: no electron dense deposits
- Antibody binds to GBM --&gt; complement --&gt; C3b deposition + C3a/C5a --&gt; PMN recruitment --&gt; proteases + ROS --&gt; tissue injury
- Lung: hemorrhage, hemoptysis, alveolar infiltrates
- Kidney: proteinuria, hematuria, renal failure

- Antibody binding to cell receptor (Type V rxns)
- Grave's disease: IgG binds to TSH-R and stimulates cell to make T3/T4
- Myasthenia Gravis: Ab to Ach-R at synapse blocks neuromuscular transmission --&gt; muscle weakness
