T Cell Activation
Monday, February 18, 2008
9:00 AM

- Antigen Encounter
- Occurs in secondary lymphoid organs
- Antigen carried from site of infection by APCs

- T Cell Recirculation
- T cells constantly recirculating btwn secondary lymphoid organs
- Enter secondary lymphoid organs from blood
- W/in secondary lymphoid organs T cells interact w/ APC
- If antigen encountered on APC, T cell becomes activated
- After several days, effector T cell enters back into blood to site of infection
- To enter lymph nodes, T cell diapedese through high endothelial venules
- Adhesion and Recirculation
- T cell adhesion to HEV involves interaction btwn integrins, immunoglobulin-superfamily molecules, selectins and vascular addressins
- T cell L-selectin interacts w/ carb groups on HEV endothelial cell addressins (GLYCAM-1 and CD34) to allow rolling o T-cells on vessel wall
- Chemokines bound to endothelial cell surface increase avidity of integrin (LFA-1) on T cell surface for immunoglobulin-superfamily member, ICAM-1 on endothelial cell surface
- Binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 promotes strong interaction btwn T cell and HEV cell --&gt; diapedesis

- Adhesion and T Cell Activation
- w/in lymphoid organs T cells make transitory contacts w/ APCs
- Adhesion mediated by LFA-1, ICAMs
- CD2 and LFA-3 also involved
- Steps of activation
- If T cell encounters the right antigen on an APC, avidity of LFA-1 for ICAM increased
- T cell-APC interaction stabilized and activation/proliferation proceeds
- Progeny of activated T cell remain in close contact w/ APC to be stimulated to undergo further rounds of activation/proliferation

- T Cell Costimulation
- In addition to TCR signal, T cells must also receive a costimulatory signal to become activated
- CD28
- Among most important receptors on T cell
- Binds B7, expressed by professional APCs

- Professional APCs
- Dendritic cells solely for antigen processing and presentation
- MHC class I pathway leading to activation of CD8 T cells
- Mature DC have poor phagocytic capacity, but usually immature cells do the phagocytosis
- Immature DC encounters antigen at site of infection
- Langerhans cell
- In skin
- ☐ Ingest extracellular material but express low levels of MHC and B7
- ☐ In response to infection, migrate to lymph nodes to mature and upregulate expression of MHC and B7
- Antigen processing and presentation at different developmental stages
- Macrophages
- Initiate immune responses to particulate extracellular antigens
- Take up antigens by phagocytosis
- Peptides are presented on MHC class II and stimulate CD4 T cell activation

- Some bacteria avoid degradation in macrophage by escaping to cytosol
- Bacterial derived peptides presented by class I
- MHC class II and B7 not expressed constitutively
- Induced by bacteria
- Cytokines

- B Cells
- Cell surface Ig molecule take up soluble protein via receptor-mediated endocytosis
- MHC class II pathway --&gt; CD4 T cells
- Do not normally express B7 molecules although can be induced to express B7 by infection

- T Cell Signal Transduction
- At outset of activation, TCR, CD4/8, CD28 and adhesion molecules cluster to appose MHC/peptide complexes on APC
- ITAMs in CD3γ, δ, ε chains and in TCRζ phosphorylated by Src-family TyrK such as FYN
- ZAP-70 binds to phosphorylated ITAMs
- CD4/8 associated w/ LCK Src-family TyrK upon recognition of MHC juxtapose LCK to ZAP-70
- LCK phosphorylates (activates) ZAP-70
- ZAP-70 triggers eventual activation of transcription factors to turn on expression of new genes involved in T cell activation
- NFAT
- NFκB
- AP
- CD28 binding to B7 results in amplification of some but not all signaling pathways
- IL-2
- Secreted T cell growth factor
- Drives clonal expansion of antigen activated T cells
- Induces T cell proliferation through binding to high affinity receptors
- Receptor not expressed by resting T cells

- T Cell Anergy
- Recognition of MHC/peptide w/o costimulation drives T cell into prolonged hypo-responsiveness (anergy)
- Fail to become activated by MHC/peptide even when costimulatory signals provided
- Mechanism for self-tolerance
- Basis for anergy is inability to produce IL-2

- T Cell Differentiation
- CD4
- Th1 cells activate macrophages and help B cells for certain types of antibody response
- Th2 cells only help B cells in antibody production
- Th17 cells recruit n'phils to site of infection
- Most of the time mixture produced although one type may dominate
- Factors controlling differentiation include
- Nature of cytokines present at time of activation
- Antigen concentration
- Affinity of TCR for MHC/peptide complex
- Which predominates can have profound circumstances on course of infection
- Mycobacterium Leprae
- Th1 --&gt; tuberculoid leprosy
- Th2 --&gt; lepromatous leprosy
- Host mounts response appropriate for elimination of infectious agent
- CD8
- Higher levels of B7 costimulation to activate
- Only dendritic cells express enough to activate directly
- CD4 cells can assist in activation
- Effector CD4 T cells can stimulate APC to express enough B7 to activate CD8 T cells
- Naïve CD4 T cells can produce IL-2 that binds to receptors on CD8 cell
