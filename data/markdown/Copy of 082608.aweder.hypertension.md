# Key Points

- Hypertension is a disease of blood pressure regulation
- Hypertension is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.
- Blood pressure measurement is important and requires attention to technique.
- Treatment decisions made in the context of overall risk factor burden.
- Secondary forms of hypertension are infrequently encountered and are usually recognized by resistance to treatment and distinctive biochemical features.

# Hypertension

= high blood pressure

# Blood Pressure Measurement

- Patients should be seated with back supported and arm bared and supported at heart level.
- Patients should refrain from smoking or ingesting caffeine for 30 minutes before measurement.
- Measurement should begin after at least 5 minutes of rest.
- Appropriate cuff size and calibrated equipment should be used.
- Both SBP and DBP should be recorded.
- Two or more readings should be averaged.

# Clinical Clues Suggesting Renovascular Hypertension

- Onset of hypertension under age 25 or over age 55
- An abdominal bruit, particularly in diastole
- Refractory, accelerated, or malignant hypertension or worsening of previously controlled hypertension
- Undiagnosed renal failure, with or without hypertension (particularly with normal urine sediment)
- Acute renal failure precipitated by hypertension treatment, particularly with ACE inhibitors
- A unilateral small kidney (by any prior investigational procedure)

- Pl. free metanephrine
- 99% sensitive and 89% specific

# Primary Prevention

- Primary prevention offers an opportunity to interrupt the costly cycle of managing hypertension.
- Lifestyle modifications have been shown to lower blood pressure.
- A population-wide approach may reduce morbidity and mortality; trials are lacking.
- Most patients with hypertension do not sufficiently change their lifestyle or adhere to drug therapy enough to achieve control.

# Goal of Hypertension Prevention and Management

- To reduce morbidity and mortality by the least intrusive means possible. This may be accomplished by
- Achieving and maintaining SBP &lt; 140 mm Hg and DBP &lt; 90 mm Hg.
- Controlling other cardiovascular risk factors.
