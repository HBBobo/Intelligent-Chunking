# Joining variable and constant regions

Wednesday, February 13, 2008

9:00 AM

- λ light chain
- L1-Vλ1 up to LVA-29 --- J1-C1---J2-C2---...
- Multiple C-λ genes, each w/ one J region
- J defines which constant region is used

- κ light chain
- L1-Vκ1 up to Lvκ-40---Jκa1-5--Cκ
- Only one Cκ gene

- Heavy chain
- LVheavy51---Dheavy1-27---Jheavy1-6---Cμ
- D segments encode 2-8 amino acids are preceded and followed by recombination signal sequences
- Heavy chain variable encodes amino acids 1-99, J encodes additional 14-20 amino acids

- Light Chain Transcription
- Germline DNA
- VJ joined
- Primary transcript mRNA
- Splicing to make continuous mRNA w/ LVJC
- Translated to polypeptide to make light chain and L spliced off

- Heavy chain transcription
- Germline DNA recombined
- DJ regions joined
- V and DJ regions joined
- Transcription to mRNA
- Splicing to make continuous LVDJC
- Translation

- Methods to generate diversity
- Germline
- Use of variable region genes
- Several D's
- Four to ten J's
- Combinatorial
- Joining of any variable region to any D to any J
- Combination of any heavy chain variable region with any light chain variable region
- 50 V X 30 D X 6 JH = 9000 heavy variable chains
- 40 V X 5 Jκ = 200 variable κ chains
- 30 V X 10 Jλ = 300 variable λ chains
- 9000 X (200+300) = 4.5 million possible binding sites
- Junctional diversity
- Generated during V(D)J joining by variation in exact point of recombination
- V-D, D-J in heavy chains
- V-J in light chains
- RAGs cut off recombination sequences and ligates them to release them
- Exonuclease cuts off nucleotides and releases coding sequences to be ligated together
- The exonuclease works anywhere
- Same number of codons but a different sequence
- Particularly prevalent in light chain variable region
- N region addition
- Addition of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase to V, D, or J ends

- Not encoded by a template
- Rare in light chains

- When in B cell differentiation do Ig gene rearrangements take place?
- In pro B cells, D is rearranged to a heavy chain J segment on both chromosomes at random
- Heavy chain V region is rearranged to DJ on one chromosome
- If out of frame/pseudogene, tries on other chromosome
- If it fails again, B cell stops development
- If μ heavy chain is expressed, becomes a pre B cell and also attempts light chain V-J rearrangement
- Further VH-DJ joining shut off
- κ is favored 20:1 over λ
- Since there are four loci that could undergo VJ rearrangement, this step is usually successful
- There are also several VJ rearrangements possible w/in a single locus
- If light chain is produced and IgM goes to cell surface, immature B cell
- If light chain is expressed, VL-JL joining shut off
- Feed-back regulation is basis of allelic exclusion
- Prevents expression of two heavy chains or two light chains

- How does B cell switch from membrane bound IgM to secreted form?
- Alternative RNA splicing
- Secreted μ has 20 aa sequence after C region
- Membrane bound has 41 aa after C region
- This sequence has n-terminal negative AA, then 26 uncharged aa (α helix) then positive charges at the C-term
- This makes it stick in the membrane
- 2 Poly(A) sites
- Secreted transcription ends at first
- Transmembrane ends at second
- MC region in btwn the two
- After those two poly(A) sites, Cδ genes then another poly(A) region
- If transcription continues to this point, mainly IgD expressed
- Cμ genes get cut out
