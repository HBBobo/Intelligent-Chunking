# Functional Organization of the Nervous System

1. Somatic (conscious afferent* and efferent, voluntary motor control)
2. Autonomic (unconscious efferent, involuntary motor control of internal organs to maintain homeostasis)
a. Sympathetic – thoracolumbar division
b. Parasympathetic – craniosacral division

* Somatic afferents = sensory fibers from skin, muscle, joints, tendons.

Visceral afferents = sensory fibers from visceral organs; some result in conscious sensations, but others do not. However, they are not considered part of the autonomic nervous system, which is entirely efferent.

# Perikarya of sensory neurons are in the PNS, often organized in ganglia

# Neurons have dendritic and axonal extension

The Law of Dynamic Polarization states that neuronal signals only travel in one direction, from dendrites to the axon. In humans axons can be up to 1.5 meters in length. In a whale axonal length can reach up to 40 meters.

Nissl substance is found in the neuronal cell body and dendrites, but not in the axon and the axon hillock or axon initial segment.

The ability of neurons to synthesize proteins at growth cones and at the presynaptic terminus is very limited.

Axonal cytoskeletal elements play a central role in the two types of transport along axons. As shown in this electron micrograph, axons contain two classes of cytoskeletal elements, neurofilaments (NF), which are intermediate filaments, and microtubules (MT).

© PD-INEL Wheeler's Functional Histology; 5th edition, 2006, Young, Lowe, Stevens and Heath; Churchill Livingstone Elsevier, Fig 7.5c

Slow axonal transport (0.2-8 mm/day) transports many proteins along the axons. The mechanism of slow axonal transport is still controversial (current Stop-Go model).

Fast axonal transport (up to 400 mm/day) is the main mechanism to move cell organelles and membrane vesicles along the axon.

Fast axonal transport goes in both directions (anterograde and retrograde) and relies on the axonal microtubule cytoskeleton.

![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

Microtubule-mediated transport of secretory granules along the axon of a neuron. The majority of granules move toward the growth cone (anterograde transport), but some move away from the growth cone (retrograde transport). There are also some granules that reverse direction, move intermittently, or stall. In this neurite, there is a partial build up of granules in the growth cone; this build up would have become more extensive with time due to the net anterograde granule flux.

Transport Disorders. PLoS Genet 2(9): Pages 1275ce -84.

Once a growth cone reaches its target, it might form synapses with its target cell. Synapses are predominantly supplied and maintained by fast, microtubule-mediated transport.

![img-19.jpeg](img-19.jpeg)
Snail growth cone stained for actin and microtubules.

Anterograde microtubule-mediated transport is mediated by kinesins and retrograde transport by dyneins.

The microtubule-mediated transport enables the tip of an axon to grow during development and to regeneration. During this time is referred to as a growth cone.

Figure 16: Wheater's Functional Histology; 5th edition, 2006, Young, Lowe, Stevens and Heath, Churchill Livingstone Elsevier, Fig 7.6a

Myelination is a dynamic process, which involves the ensheathment of the axon by the glial cell and subsequently the extrusion of cytoplasm from parts of the glial cell. Adhesive proteins on the cytoplasmic and the extracellular side of the plasma membrane contribute to a tight apposition of the lipid bilayers.

Nodes of Ranvier are areas of the myelinated axon that are not covered by the myelin sheath. They are bordered by paranodal regions, which form paranodal junctions with the axonal plasma membrane and also retain some Schwann cell cytoplasm.

Ion channels are concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier and the myelin sheath acts as an electrical insulator. This allows for saltatory conductance of the action potential and increases the transmission speed of the nerve impuls.

Depending on the diameter of the axon, myelination increases the action potential speed approximately 5 to 50fold (up to $&gt;110\mathrm{m / sec}$).

This organ of Golgi is an encapsulated stretch receptor. The capsule contains collagen fibers and endings of a single nerve fiber that is connected with interneurons in the spinal cord. Stretching forces will result in a depolarization of the axon and an inhibitory muscle reflex to protect muscles and tendons from excessive force.
