# Types of Hosts

Intermediate Hosts

- Hosts in which asexual replications occurs
- If no replication occurs, the intermediate host is known as a transport or paratenic host
- e.g. Toxoplasmosis gondii - various vertebrates
- Plasmodium Spp. - vertebrate blood and tissues

Definitive Hosts

- Hosts in which the sexual cycle occurs
- e.g. Toxoplasmosis gondii - wild and domestic cats
- Plasmodium spp. - mosquitoes (Diptera)

# Major "Groups" of Apicomplexa

- Gregarines - septate &amp; aseptate (considered "primitive") - parasites of invertebrates - extracellular
- Coccidia - homoxenous and heteroxenous species
- eimerid coccidia (Eimeria, Lankesterella, etc)
- isosporoid coccidia (Sarcocystis, Toxoplasmosis, Neospora, etc.)
- Cryptosporidium spp.
- Haemosporinids - malarial parasites and their relatives
- Piroplasms - Babesia, Theileria and their relatives
- Haemogrgarines - Haemogregarina, Heptozoon, etc.

- Tachyzoites can move by gliding, flexing, undulating, and rotating
- No visible means of locomotion such as cilia, flagella, or pseudopodia
- Functions of the conoid, rhoptries, micropores, and micronemes are not fully known
- Probably associated with host cell penetration
- The conoid can rotate, tilt, extend, and retract as the parasite probes the host cell plasmalemma immediately before penetration

IN SUMMARY
TOXOPLASMOSIS

HST 071

- Rhoptries have a secretory function associated with host cell penetration, secreting their contents through the plasmalemma just above the conoid to the exterior
- Tachyzoites multiply asexually within the host cell by repeated endodyogeny
- Specialized form of reproduction - two progeny form within the parent parasite consuming it
- Golgi complex divides first - becoming two complexes at the anterior end of the nucleus. The host cell ruptures when it can no longer support the growth of tachyzoites
- After the ingestion of tissue cysts by cats, the cyst wall is dissolved by proteolytic enzymes in the stomach and small intestine.
- Released bradyzoites penetrate the epithelial cells of the small intestine and initiate the development of numerous generations of T. gondii
- Five morphologically distinct types of T. gondii develop in intestinal epithelial cells before gametogony begins

IN SUMMARY
TOXOPLASMOSIS

HST 071

# Factors Determining Expression of Disease

- The susceptibility of the host
- Age of the host
- The strain of the pathogen
- The degree of acquired immunity

# Prevalence

- Overall world prevalence ~13%
- Diet Uncooked or poorly cooked meat is eaten
- Immuno-compromised host
- ☐ Patient is undergoing suppressive therapy
- ☐ Transplant patients
- ☐ HIV

# Spread by the Cat

- Only members of the cat family shed oocysts
- Cats become infected by ingesting
- ☐ Oocysts from fecal contamination
- ☐ A cat can excrete 107 to 109 oocytes per day
- ☐ Tissue cysts present in the flesh of eaten animals

Digestive enzymes release the organisms

Invade the feline small intestine

The organisms reproduce

- Producing millions of noninfectious, unsporulated oocysts
- Excreted in feces of cats for up to 2 weeks

Outside the cat’s body

- Sporogony occurs for up to 21 days
- Development of infectious oocysts
- Warm, moist soil - oocysts viable for more than 1 year

# Intermediate Hosts

- Herbivores/omnivores - Type 1 Host
- Carnivores - Type 2 Host

Distinctive Differences in the life cycle stages

IN SUMMARY
TOXOPLASMOSIS

HST 071

## Herbivore/omnivore - intermediate host
- Hosts infected by eating sporulated oocysts
- Each oocyst contains 2 sporocysts with 4 sporozoites

## Liberated sporozoites infect extra-intestinal sites
- Acute phase
- Mesenteric lymph nodes
- Liver
- Chronic
- Brain
- Heart
- Skeletal muscles

Sporozoites - infect the intestinal epithelial cells
undergo schizogony

## Only in the cat
- Sexual phase of the parasite (gametogony) observed
- Poduces a single celled oocyte
- Cycles through the cat rapidly (3-5 days)
- Cat does not appear to suffer much discomfort
- Quickly replaces damaged epithelial cells
- Kittens - more susceptible and some die of the infection.

## Sporozoites divide by endodyogeny
[Endodyogeny - Formation of daughter cells each surrounded by its own membrane, while still in the mother cell]

## Form pseudocysts
- Contain merozoites (tachyzoites)
- Can infect other cells and form tissue cysts.

## Pseudocyst and Tissue cysts
Require the host to be devoured by a carnivore (type 2 host) to continue life cycle

Both are infective to cats.

IN SUMMARY
TOXOPLASMOSIS

HST 071

# Human Spread

## Spread of the merozoites usually prevented by the host immune response
- Predominately a cellular one
- Persisting as long as the host remains infected
- Usually for life

## If tissue cysts eaten by a carnivore other than a cat
- Released merozoites
- Penetrate extra intestinal cells
- Form pseudocysts
- Produce more merozoites or **bradyzoites**
- Lead to the production of tissue cysts
- Transmission via the placenta in females to the fetus occurs

## Insects
- Flies and cockroaches - can act as transport hosts
- Disseminating the oocysts

## Review of Basic Facts About Toxoplasmosis
- **Toxoplasma gondii** - obligate intracellular parasite
- Properties similar to the pathogen that causes malaria
- One of the most common human parasites in the world
- First discovered in the gundi, a North African rodent
- Members of the cat family are the definitive hosts
- Domestic cats play a major role in transmission
- Congenital infection is the only form of human-to-human transmission.

## Presenting History
- Acquired toxoplasmosis can present with a range of clinical manifestations, from subclinical lymphadenopathy (the most common presentation) to fatal, fulminant disease
- In healthy adults, infection with *T gondii* usually is subclinical.
- In the immunocompetent host, infection with *T gondii* may be indistinguishable from infectious mononucleosis.
- In immunocompromised hosts, toxoplasmosis may **mimic** other opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis or infection with *P carinii*.
- In patients with AIDS, CNS involvement is the most common manifestation, followed by pulmonary involvement.

## Physical Findings
- Toxoplasmosis cannot be diagnosed on clinical grounds alone
- May mimic a variety of other diseases.
- No clinical features are pathognomonic for toxoplasmosis
- Lymphadenopathy is the most common finding

HST 071

# Laboratory Studies

- The immunoglobulin (IgM) immunofluorescent antibody test (IgM-IFA)
- An IgM-IFA titer of 1:160 or greater
- IgM-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IgM-ELISA) titer of 1:256 or greater
- Considered diagnostic of recently acquired *T gondii* infection

# Imaging Studies

- MRI
- ☐ Considered best diagnostic imaging modality
- ☐ May detect lesion not visualized on C-T
- ☐ May find single or multiple lesions
- Ring enhancing
- Basal ganglia
- Cortico-medullary regions

# Other Tests

- Cerebrospinal fluid
- Mononuclear pleocytosis
- Elevated protein
- Normal glucose
- Presence of tissue cysts is diagnostic for toxoplasmosis
- Does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection
- Presence of either tachyzoites or toxoplasmal antigens in tissue or smears confirms acute infection
- Brain biopsy
- May reveal presence of tachyzoites

# Histologic Diagnosis

- Tachyzoites in tissue sections or smears of body fluid
- Difficult to demonstrate tachyzoites in conventionally stained tissue sections immunoperoxidase technique
- Uses antisera to *T. gondii*,
- Sensitive and specific
- Presence of the parasite in the central nervous system (AIDS)
- Applicable to unfixed or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections

IN SUMMARY
TOXOPLASMOSIS

HST 071

# Ocular Toxoplasmosis

- Acquired toxoplasmosis may be seen
- Majority of cases are felt to be a reactivation of a congenital toxoplasmosis
- Characterized by an acute retino-choroiditis
- Marked vitreous reaction overlying the active infection
- "headlight in the fog"
- Healed lesion leads to a large scar

# Sabin-Feldman Dye Test

IgG antibodies are primarily measured by the Sabin-Feldman Dye Test Sensitive and specific neutralization test

Live organisms are lysed
- Presence of complement
- The patient's IgG T. gondii-specific antibody

- Becomes positive 1 to 3 weeks after infection
- Titer increases for many months
- Gradually decles over a period of 5 years or more
- May remain positive for life
- Titers of 1:4 are significant
- Titers of 1:8 or 1:16 usually should be considered as positive.

Rising titers - 2 weeks apart indicate recently acquired infection

# IgG antibodies

- Usually appear within 1 to 2 weeks of the infection
- Peak within 1 to 2 months
- Fall at variable rates
- Persist for life
- Titer does not correlate with the severity of illness

A positive DT = patient has been exposed to the parasite

A negative DT essentially rules out prior exposure to T. gondii

# Small number of patients

- IgG antibodies might not be detected within 2 to 3 weeks
- Toxoplasmic chorioretinitis
- Toxoplasmic encephalitis) in immuno-compromised patients

IN SUMMARY
TOXOPLASMOSIS

# Differential Agglutination Test

- Also known as the "AC/HS test"
- Two antigen preparations
- Early following acute infection (AC antigen)
- Later stages of infection (HS)
- Ratios of titers using AC versus HS antigens
- Acute (may persist for one or more years)
- Equivocal
- Non-acute
- Useful in helping differentiate acute from chronic infections
- Best used in combination with a panel of other tests

# Avidity Testing

- Functional affinity of specific IgG antibodies
- Initially low after primary antigenic challenge
- Increases during subsequent weeks and months
- Protein-denaturing reagents (urea) used to dissociate the antibody-antigen complex.
- Avidity result is determined using the ratios of antibody titration curves of urea-treated and untreated serum.

Used as additional confirmatory diagnostic tool
- patients with a positive and/or equivocal IgM
- acute and/or equivocal pattern in the AC/HS test

- Confirmatory test
- Not the ultimate test for decision-making
- Low or equivocal IgG avidity antibody results should not be interpreted as diagnostic of recently acquired infection
- Low or equivocal avidity antibodies can persist for months to one year or longer.

# IgM Antibodies

- Measured by the "double-sandwich" or "immuno-capture" IgM-ELISA
- Avoids false positive results
- Rheumatoid factor
- Antinuclear antibodies
- In recently acquired infection
- IgM T. gondii antibodies are detected initially
- Become negative within a few months
- Occasionally positive IgM T. gondii-specific titers can be observed during the chronic stage of the infection
- IgM antibodies have been reported to persist as long as 12 years
- Persistence has no clinical relevance – chronically infected
- The FDA recommends: sera with positive IgM test results obtained at non-reference laboratories should be sent to a Toxoplasma reference laboratory (Such as Remington or CDC Labs)

IN SUMMARY
TOXOPLASMOSIS
