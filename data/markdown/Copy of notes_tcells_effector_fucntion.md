# T Cell Effector Function

Monday, February 18, 2008

10:00 AM

- T cell-mediated immunity
- Following activation, most T cells leave secondary lymphoid organ
- Th2 cells remain
- Effector fxn mediated by various effector molecules
- Effector fxn triggered by MHC/peptide binding
- T Cell Effectors
- Change in types of cell surface adhesion molecule expressed
- L-Selectin turned-off and cells cease to recirculate btwn secondary lymphoid organs
- Expression of VLA-4 integrin turned-on to allow T cell binding to vascular endothelium and access to extracellular space where infection might be focused
- Expression of LFA-1 and CD2 increased
- Upon recognition of specific MHC/peptide complexes, integrin avidity increased to allow stable association w/ tgts
- Effector T cells do not require costimulation to act
- Effector Molecules
- Cytokines
- ☐ Hematopoietins - IL-2,3,4,5 and GMCSF
- ☐ Interferons - IFN-γ
- ☐ TNF-family: TNF, FasL, CD40L
- ☐ Others: IL-10, TGF, IL-17
- ☐ Secreted or membrane bound
- ☐ Synergistic actions
- ☐ Act locally over short distance
- ☐ Act via JAK-STAT pathway
- Cytotoxins
- ☐ Perforin
- ☐ Granzymes
- T Cell Effector Fxn
- General
- CD8 utilize cytokines and cytotoxins
- CD4 only uses cytokines
- Different combinations used by Th1 and Th2
- ☐ Th1 uses IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-β
- ☐ Th2 uses IL-4,5,10
- CD8
- Main fxn is to kill tgt cells that have become overwhelmed by virus
- Importance of CTL demonstrated by lack of CTL --&gt; persistent viral infections
- Killing fxn triggered by TCR recognition of MHC/viral peptide displayed upon surface of infected tgt cells
- Mechanism
- ☐ As soon as CD8 activated by APCs, perforin and granzymes synthesized by the developing CTL and loaded into specialized granules
- ☐ Upon tgt cell recognition, granules fuse w/ CTL membrane and contents released twd tgt cell
- ☐ Perforin forms pores in tgt cell membrane
- ☐ Granzymes (serine proteases) enter cell
- ☐ Granzymes cleave and activate tgt cell proteases (Caspases)
- ☐ Caspases degrade many proteins --&gt; cell death

□ Viral proteins also degraded as part of apoptotic death process
□ Death is irreversible after 5 mins of interaction

- Death is selective for infected cells and single CTL can kill multiple tgts
- Death is by apoptosis (cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation)
- CTLs also express FasL on cell surface to bind to Fas death receptor on tgt cells
- Engagement also results in Caspase activation
- Induction of apoptosis
- Defective Fas or FasL --&gt; autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome

- MHC/peptide + B7 from APC --&gt; expansion of T cells --&gt; apoptotic death (receptor mediated and mitochondrial dysfunction)
- Tissue cell --&gt; limited expansion --&gt; apoptosis and elimination
- CTLs also produce IFN-γ upon ligand recognition
- Inhibits viral replication
- Augments MHC class I antigen processing
- Activates macrophages

- Th1
- Activate macrophages
- Triggered by TCR recognition of class II/peptide complexes
- Macrophage activation important for destruction of ingested microbes that are able to survive w/in macrophage vesicular system and are resistant to standard macrophage killing mechanisms
- Macrophage Activation
- Mycobacteria are able to resist m'phage killing by preventing acidification of phagolysosome (req to activate lysosomal hydrolases)
- Activated m'phages have increased rate of phago-lyso fusion and increased synthesis of microbicidal substances
- Activated m'phages also express more class II and B7
- Two signals delivered by Th1 to m'phage
- Sensitizing signal from CD40L interaxn w/ m'phage CD40
- Activating signal from IFN-γ
- TNFα acts synergistically
- Synthesis of CD40L and IFN-γ induced by TCR recognition of MHC/peptide
- Activated m'phages have higher expression of receptors for CD40 and TNFα
- Th1 cells coordinate multi-faceted attack
- IFN-γ and CD40L --&gt; mphage activation
- FasL
- IL-2
- IL-3+GM-CSF --&gt; m'phage differentiation in bone marrow
- LT + TNFα --&gt; diapedesis of WBCs
- MCP --&gt; m'phages accumulate at site of infection
- Granulomas
- Microbes resist killing --&gt; granuloma
- Central core of fused activated m'phages surrounded by single activated m'phages and T cells
- Prevent widespread dissemination of pathogen w/in host

- Th2
- Provide help to B cells in production of antibodies
- Involves cognate interaxn btwn Th2 and B cells
- TCR recognition of MHC/peptide displayed on B cell surface triggers Th2
- Antigen-specific
- Cognate interaction required for effective help b/c cytokines act only over short distances and CD40L is membrane bound
- B cells w/ cell surface antibodies of antigenic specificities different from that of Th2

Lecture Page 34

cell will process Th2 antigen very poorly

☐ Linked recognition has important implications for vaccine design and regulation of self-tolerance

- Th2 cells that recognize B cells w/ class II-peptide complex in 2ndary lymphoid organs increases integrin avidity to form stable Th2-B cell conjugates
- Th2 expresses CD40L and IL-4 which together with signals from B cell antigen receptor stimulates B cell clonal expansion
- Th2 cell derived IL-5 and 6 promote B cell differentiation into plasma cells
