# Systole &amp; Diastole

Text books vary in definitions but most the common use of the unmodified terms “systole” and “diastole” is:

**Systole** is the *period* from the closing of the atrio-ventricular valve (mitral) to the closing of the aortic valve (ventricular contraction).

**Diastole** is the *period* from the closing of the aortic valve to the closing of the atrio-ventricular valve (ventricular relaxation and filling).

EXTRA NOTE: Some more rigorous texts distinguish *ventricular* systole from *arterial* systole:

*Ventricular systole* is the period from the closing of the atrio-ventricular valve (mitral) until its opening.

*Arterial systole* is the period from the opening of the aortic valve until its closing.

# Origins of the Heart Beat

- Automaticity: the ability to initiate its own beat.
- Rhythmicity: regularity of pace-making activity.
- Pacemaker: the region of the heart that ordinarily generates impulses at the greatest frequency.
- Sinoatrial (SA) node: normal, main pacemaker.
- Intrinsic rate: ~100b/minute for SA node
- vs. resting rate
- Ectopic foci or pacemakers: regions other than SA node that initiate beat.

19

# Variations in the Heart Rate (fast)

- Tachycardia: heart rate greater than normal.
- Sinus tachycardia: a heart rate greater than normal (&gt; 100b/min) from SA node.
- Ectopic tachycardia: a heart rate greater than normal originating from ectopic focus.
- Paroxysmal tachycardia: a heart rate greater than normal originating from ectopic focus that begins and ends abruptly.

20

# Variations in the Heart Rate (slow)

- Bradycardia: a heart rate less than normal.
- Sinus bradycardia: a heart rate less than normal (&lt; 60 beats/minute) from SA node.
- Idiojunctional Rhythm: AV nodal rhythm when SA node fails. 40-60 b/minute
- Idioventricular Rhythm: Ectopic ventricular rhythm when SA &amp; AV nodes fails. 20-40 b/minute

**Preload** - The ventricular wall tension at the end of diastole.

**Afterload** -- The ventricular wall tension during contraction; the resistance that must be overcome for the ventricle to eject its contents. Approximated by systolic ventricular or arterial pressure.

**Contractility** -- Property of heart muscle that accounts for changes in strength of contraction independent of preload and afterload.

- What are the clinical concerns?
- What makes each go up and down? Physiologically and pathophysiologically?

# Pulmonary-Artery versus Central Venous Catheter to Guide Treatment of Acute Lung Injury

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network

© PG-ENEL New England Journal of Medicine

**Conclusions:** PAC-guided therapy did not improve survival or organ function but was associated with more complications than CVC-guided therapy. These results, when considered with those of previous studies, suggest that the PAC should not be routinely used for the management if acute lung injury.

PAC

Pulmonary artery catheter use is associated with reduced mortality in severely injured patients: A National Trauma Data Bank analysis of 53,312 patients*

Randall S. Friese, MD; Shahid Shafi, MD; Larry M. Gentilello, MD

Conclusions: Trauma patients managed with a PAC are more severely injured and have a higher mortality. However, severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score, 25–75) who arrive in severe shock, and older patients, have an associated survival benefit when managed with a PAC. This is the first study to demonstrate a benefit of PAC use in trauma patients. (Crit Care Med 2006; 34:1597–1601)

thanks for your interest,

i have no problem with you using it as a PDF on the web page..attached is the PDF...in answer to the safety...there are two large trials ongoing ...one in the US from NIH and the other in UK...they should answer the outstanding questions for us...ps... there is nothing inherently wrong with the catheter...just with the users!
