HST 071

# IN SUMMARY

# FIBROIDS

- Smooth muscle tumors of the uterus, very common;
- Occur in more than one third of women over the age of 35
- Complaints include discharge, bleeding from the vagina, pain, pressure
- Circumscribed - but not truly encapsulated
- Tumor can be readily "shelled out." - is glistening gray
- Composed of interdigitating bundles of smooth muscle.
- Incidence in black women three times greater than in white women.
- Strong hormonal relationship

# LOCATION

- Intramural, subserosal, and submucosal
- Subserosal and submucosal leiomyomas may become pedunculated
- Submucosal leiomyomas most important - bleeding symptoms may occur
- May occur in the cervix and broad ligaments as well
- Few mitoses are present
- Their spindle shape is readily apparent.
- When the cells are cut across the nuclei appear round
- Frequently undergo degeneration. - hyaline and cystic
- Presence of large amounts of connective tissue - known as fibromyomas or "fibroids"
- Bleeding symptoms caused in part by thinning of the overlying endometrium
- Vessels are not capable of retracting in the usual manner
- No basal zone from which the overlying thin layer of endometrium can regenerate
- Submucous, pedunculated leiomyomas may prolapse
- Necrosis in intramural leiomyomas - Only one artery supplies the leiomyoma
- May calcify or undergo "red" degeneration

# ATYPICALITY

- Atypicalities occur in leiomyomas - may be confused with leiomyosarcomas
- Mitotic rate is characteristically less than 5 per 10 high-power fields
- Intravascular leiomyoma - rare tumor - nodular masses of histologically benign smooth muscle growing within veins

# INCIDENCE &amp; ETIOLOGY

- Most common solid pelvic tumors in women
- Clinically apparent in 20% to 25% of women during the reproductive years
- Pathologic inspection of the uterus - present in more than 80%
- Leiomyomas are clonal in origin
- Classic paradigm – caused by and stimulated to grow by
- Estrogen
- Progesterone

It is now clear that the following are responsible for fibroid growth
- Transforming growth factor-s
- Basic fibroblast growth factor
- Somatic mutations of genes such as HMGI-C

Fibroids are characterized by their location in the uterus
- Subserosal leiomyomas
- Intramural leiomyomas
- Submucous leiomyomas

- Few leiomyomas are actually of a single "pure" type
- Most leiomyomas are hybrids that span more than one anatomic location
- Increased incidence of leiomyomas in women of color
- Risk is increased in women with greater body mass index
- Decreased in women who smoke or who have given birth

IN SUMMARY
FIBROIDS
HST 071

- Good epidemiological evidence to suggest that use of oral contraceptive
- Birth control pills decreases the risk for leiomyomas
- 20% and 50% of women with leiomyomas have tumor-related symptoms

- Fibroids often cause
- Abnormal uterine bleeding
- Prolonged menstrual flow (menorrhagia)
- Submucous leiomyomas appear to be particularly prone
- Pelvic pressure.
- Increase in uterine size
- Pressure of particular myomas on adjacent structures
- Colon - constipation
- Bladder - urinary frequency.
- Ureters - hydronephrosis
- Recurrent miscarriage
- Infertility
- Premature labor
- Fetal malpresentation
- Complications of labor

# DIAGNOSIS

- Easily determined by bimanual examination
- Uterus is enlarged
- Mobile
- Irregular
- Palpated abdominally above the symphysis
- Ultrasonography most common method for diagnosis
- Submucous fibroid can be missed on traditional ultrasonography

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
- Electron spin characteristics can often distinguish
- Leiomyomas
- Adenomyomas
- Leiomyosarcomas

- Primary therapy for patients with large or symptomatic leiomyomas is surgery
- Hysterectomy is the most often
- United States: more than 175,000 hysterectomies are performed yearly for leiomyomas
- Diagnosis of leiomyoma the most common indication for this procedure
- Hysterectomy, the only true "cure" for leiomyoma, is a surgical option when women are no longer interested in future pregnancies

- Subtraction angiography
- Easily visualize the fibroids and also embolize them in order to cause infarction
- May dramatically reduce bleeding as well as size.

- Myomectomy
- 18,000 myomectomies are performed yearly
- Myomectomy diminishes menorrhagia in roughly 80%
- Significant risk for recurrence of leiomyomas
- Ultrasonography evidence of recurrence in 25% to 51% of patients
- 10% require a second major operative procedure

- GnRH agonists (Lupron, Naferelin, Gosserelin)
- Induce a hypo estrogenic pseudo menopausal state
- Fibroids are dependent on estrogen for their development and growth
- Hypo estrogenic state causes shrinkage
- Uterine volume has been shown to decrease 40% to 60% after 3 months

IN SUMMARY
FIBROIDS
HST 071

- Induces amenorrhea
- increase iron stores and hemoglobin concentrations
- Cessation of GnRH agonist treatment results in rapid re-growth
- GnRH agonist treatment is useful as a pre-surgical treatment
- Not a long-term treatment option

- Androgenic agents
- Danazol
- Gestrinone

- Progestins
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera)
- Depo medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera)
- Norethindrone

- Do not consistently decrease uterine or fibroid volume
- Mechanism of action is thought to be the induction of endometrial atrophy
- Often not successful in controlling significant menorrhagia
- Somatic mutation is the initial event in most tumorigenesis
- Somatic mutations include a variety of chromosomal aberrations

Point mutations or Chromosomal loss or gain.
- Large chromosomal abnormalities such as translocations and deletions often detected with standard cytogenetic karyotypes
- Independent monoclonal origin of individual myomas
- Suggests somatic mutations offer a selective growth advantage to the mutated myocyte

## Variety of chromosomal rearrangements
- Most common 12q14-15 and 7q22
- Heterogeneity of the cytogenetic abnormalities
- Different somatic mutations may be involved in myoma tumorigenesis
- Unique somatic mutations in individual myomas
- Biologic basis for the differential responsiveness of individual myomas to a variety of growth-promoting agents

## SOME THOUGHTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF FIBROIDS
- Clonal proliferation precedes the development of cytogenetic rearrangements
- Somatic mutations which cannot be detected cytogenetically with the light microscope are the initial events in myoma tumorigenesis.
- Explains the absence of cytogenetic abnormalities in a large proportion of myoma specimens.

- ER alpha and ER beta mRNA expressed in leiomyoma and normal myometrium.
- Expression of ER alpha higher than ER beta in both leiomyoma &amp; myometrium
- ER alpha expression is increased in leiomyoma compared to that the adjacent normal myometrium
- ER beta expression is same or lower in leiomyoma than in the adjacent normal myometrium
- Estrogen considered the major promoter of myoma growth
- The long-term administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist associated with both hypoestrogenemia and a reduction in myoma volume
- Concentration of estradiol significantly higher in myomas than in normal myometrium.
- Lower conversion of estradiol to estrone in myomas than myometrium.

IN SUMMARY
FIBROIDS
HST 071

- Significantly increased concentration of estrogen receptors in myomas compared with autologous myometrium
- Observations suggest intramyoma hormonal milieu is hyperestrogenic
- No evidence that estrogen directly stimulates myoma growth
- Mitogenic effects of estrogen are likely mediated by other factors and their receptors.
- Several estrogen-regulated genes have been confirmed
- Evidence to suggest that estrogen stimulates
- progesterone receptor
- epidermal growth factor
- insulin-like growth factor-I
- Regulation of myoma extracellular matrix
- Estrogen directly stimulates collagen types I and III m-RNA
- Stimulates expression of gap junction protein connexin-43
- Stimulates local production of the parathyroid hormone related peptide
- Expression of these estrogen-regulated genes appears to be greater in uterine myomas than in the adjacent myometrium.
- Hypersensitivity to estrogen may be important in the pathogenesis of myomas.
- Ultrastructural features of cultured smooth muscle cells from uterine myomas and normal myometrium
- Myoma and myometrial cells in estrogen and progesterone media more active under EM than cells in estrogen only medium.
- Progesterone exposure -&gt; increased number of myofilaments with dense bodies (suggesting that progesterone is involved in myoma differentiation)
- Increased progesterone receptor m-RNA expression
- Increased progesterone receptor protein levels in myoma tissue compared with adjacent myometrium
