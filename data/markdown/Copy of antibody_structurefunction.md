Antibody Structure and Function
Monday, February 11, 2008
10:00 AM

- Antibody Structure
- Derived from monoclonal antibodies secreted by plasmacytomas
- All antibodies made of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains
- Constant Region
- Located in carboxy part of chain
- Light chains: numbered 108-214, κ and λ
- Heavy chain: α, γ, δ, ε, μ
- γ1, 2, 3, 4
- α 1 and 2
- Subclasses have exactly same sequence
- Variable Region
- AA sequence in amino terminal part never the same for two immunoglobulins
- Light chain residues 1-107
- Variability = number of different amino acids at a residue/frequency of the most frequent amino acid
- Hypervariable regions w/in a variable region have variability from 15-100
- Hypervariable regions come together to form antigen binding site = complementarity determining region (CDR)
- Framework regions are clusters of amino acid residues btw HV regions w/ variability of 1-20; form scaffold upon which variable region is built
- Domains have 110 amino acid units with disulfide bridge btw two cysteines
- Folding of the Immunoglobulin
- Variable and constant regions fold the same and are independent of each other
- Parallel β-pleated sheets perpendicular to the cys-cys bond
- HV residues clustered near each other and form the antigen binding pocket
- Not every HV region contacts antigen

- Antibody Function
- Antibody Classes
- IgM: 4 constant region domains, 1.5 mg/ml in serum; fixes complement, opsinin
- IgG: 3 constant region domains, proline rich hinge, 13.5 mg/ml in serum; opsinin, some subclasses fix complement, some cross placenta
- IgA: 3 constant region domains, proline rich hinge; secreted at mucosal surface; only immunoglobulin that exits body
- IgE: 4 constant region domains; binds mast cells, allergies
- IgD: 3 constant region domains, proline rich hinge; cell surface only
- Individual immunoglobulin has either κ or γ light chain
- Opsinins are antibodies that enhance phagocytosis
- Hinge is 20-30 aa region that is proline rich
- IgA includes attached secretory piece which protects against proteolysis
- Not all secreted as individual molecules
- IgM secreted as pentamer w/ J chain in middle
- IgA secreted as dimers w/ J chain
- Fragments created by limited digestion of antibodies w/ proteolytic enzymes; each class or subclass of heavy chain has a different amino acid sequence and hence a different Fc region
- Different effector functions of different classes and subclasses of antibodies are mediated by binding to specific Fc receptors
- Fc(ε)RI on mast cells, eosinophils
- Poly Ig receptor on mucosal epithelia - IgA

Lecture Page 2

- Fc(γ) receptor on macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils
- Opsinins bind go IgG

- b/c each subclass has a different constant regions different Fc receptors bind different classes and subclasses of Ig
- Each subclass of Ig has specific set of effector fxns
- All antibodies can use same variable regions
- But with different constant regions, way pathogen is handled after binding is different for each subclass
