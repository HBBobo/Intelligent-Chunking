IN SUMMARY

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome

# POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME

## Presence of oligo- or anovulation in combination with hyperandrogenism.

- Chronic anovulation may present as irregular menstrual periods or amenorrhea.
- It is not essential to document anovulation by ultrasonography or progesterone measurements in the presence of a clear clinical history
- PCOS occurs in 85 to 90% of women with oligomenorrhea and in 30-40% of women with amenorrhea
- Diagnosed either by clinical (hirsutism) or laboratory (elevated testosterone or androstenedione)
- Should not be diagnosed if evidence of other causes of oligo-ovulation and hyperandrogenism (ovarian androgen secreting tumor or nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia)
- Prevalence of PCOS is approximately 5–7% of women of reproductive age
- 50% of PCOS women are obese and tend to have an android pattern of obesity

## Elevated levels of serum LH - increased LH pulse amplitude and LH pulse frequency

- Steady-state levels of gonadotropins and ovarian steroids
- “chronic estrous state”
- Proliferation and hyperplasia of the endometrium
- Can lead to unpredictable bleeding episodes
- Unopposed estrogen exposure -confirmed by progesterone withdrawal test

- Women with PCOS have higher mean concentrations of LH
- Increased bioactivity of LH
- Low to low-normal levels of follicle stimulating hormone

- Obese PCOS women do not have elevated LH levels
- ☐ normal LH level or normal LH/FSH ratio does not rule out PCOS
- ☐ LH/FSH ratio is now not included in the diagnostic criteria of PCOS

- In research studies almost all women with PCOS have elevated LH secretion.
- In clinical practice - difficult to use a single measurement of LH to diagnose PCOS,
- LH is secreted in a pulsatile manner
- Normal range of serum LH concentration decreases with increasing body mass index (BMI)

# Association between hyperinsulinemia and PCOS

- First noted by 1980
- Significant positive correlation between insulin, androstenedione and testosterone levels among PCOS women
- It is estimated that 20-40% of PCOS women have impaired glucose tolerance
- Seven-fold higher than the rates in age and weight-matched women
- Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is also increased in PCOS women (15% versus 2.3% in normal women)
- Lean PCOS women have lower rates of carbohydrate intolerance
- Lean PCOS women still have higher rates than age and weight-matched controls. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance independent of total or fat-free body mass
- Obese PCOS women are more insulin resistant than obese non-PCOS or non-obese PCOS women
- Pancreatic beta cell secretory dysfunction in a subset of PCOS women
- Probably has the highest risk of developing carbohydrate intolerance
- Type 2 diabetes.
- Oral glucose tolerance tests recommended for obese PCOS patients
- PCOS in 8 out 30 premenopausal women with type 2 diabetes
- Insulin resistance is characterized by post-receptor defect in the action of insulin
- Cause of this defect is still being elucidated

# Action of insulin

- Binds to the cell-surface receptor
- Receptor undergoes auto-phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues
- Accomplished by activation of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase
- Activated receptor then activates insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1,2 and 3)
- Binds to signaling molecules such as PI3 kinase
- Activates downstream signaling
- Leads to insulin-mediated glucose transport

IN SUMMARY

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome

# PCO insulin resistance

- Abnormalities in both insulin receptor tyrosine kinase
- Mediators distal to the receptor are present in insulin resistance states
- Adipocytes from women with PCOS
- Adipocyte insensitivity to inhibition of lipolysis by insulin
- Decrease in maximal rates of adipocyte glucose uptake
- Occur in PCOS in the absence of obesity
- Decreased insulin receptor auto-phosphorylation in 50% of fibroblasts removed from PCOS women
- Due to increased receptor serine phosphorylation
- Serine phosphorylation - associated with decreased insulin receptor tyrosine auto-phosphorylation

- In vitro human theca cell studies
- Insulin has direct stimulatory effects on ovarian steroidogenesis
- Insulin produced a greater increase in androgen production by theca cells in PCOS than in cells obtained without PCOS
- Effect is mediated specifically through insulin receptor
- Insulin enhances the effect of LH on preovulatory ovarian follicles
- Premature activation and subsequent follicle arrest
- Hyperinsulinemia (due to insulin resistance) drives the LH effect on ovarian theca cells
- Causes androgen excess which are intrinsically programmed to produce more androgen
- Excess androgens are known to interfere with the process of follicular maturation
- Inhibiting ovulation
- Producing more arrested follicles

- 1983 it was proposed that severe hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance results in ovarian hyperandrogenism (Barbieri &amp; Ryan)
- PCOS is associated with insulin resistance independent of total or fat free body mass
- Hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance and acanthosis nigricans syndrome

- Cause of the insulin resistance – germ line mutation in the insulin receptor gene
- Prevents normal function of the insulin receptor.

- Puberty: LH secretion rises
- Severe insulin resistance
- LH stimulation → hypersecretion of testosterone by the ovary
- Often present with severe insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism including virilization and amenorrhea

IN SUMMARY

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome

HST 071

- Acanthosis nigricans
- Dermatologic manifestation of the hyperinsulinemia
- Hyperandrogenism

- Clinical criteria suggestive of insulin resistance
- BMI greater than 27 kg/m2
- Waist-to-hip ratio greater than 0.85
- Presence of acanthosis nigricans

- Laboratory criteria
- Elevated fasting insulin concentration
- Elevated glucose-to-insulin ratio

- Must have 2 of the following 3 manifestations
- Irregular or absent ovulation
- Elevated levels of androgenic hormones
- Enlarged ovaries containing at least 12 follicles each

- Polycystic ovaries are defined - on ultrasound
- To contain 12 or more follicles
- Measuring 2 to 9 mm in diameter
- Increased volume of 10 mL or greater
- Only one ovary fulfilling these criteria is enough

- Polycystic ovaries are not necessary feature of PCOS
- Many women with polycystic ovaries do not have PCOS
- Should not be considered to have PCOS unless there is corroborating clinical evidence of the syndrome.

- Treatment of insulin resistance
- Can reduce ovarian androgen secretion and
- Cause the resumption of ovulatory menses.
- Cause-effect relationship between insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism-anovulation.

- Typical Presentation
- Chief compliant of hirsutism
- Irregular menses
- Infertility

- Treatment of Hirsutism
- Combination of an estrogen-progestin contraceptive
- Antiandrogen (spironolactone)

IN SUMMARY

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome

HST 071

- Standard treatment for infertility
- Clomiphene citrate and weight loss

Treatment with insulin sensitizers, metformin (biguanide which reduces plasma glucose concentrations in type 2 diabetes) and thiazolidinediones (Troglitazone and Rosiglitazone), improve both metabolic and hormonal patterns and also improve ovulation in PCOS

- Metformin
- Does not lead to weight gain
- Can induce weight loss
- Predominantly works by reducing hepatic glucose production
- Inhibiting gluconeogenesis both directly and indirectly (by decreasing free fatty acid concentrations)
- May slightly improve peripheral insulin sensitivity in PCOS
- Reductions in androgen levels
- Improvements in ovulation
- Reduce the high rates of gestational diabetes in PCOS

- Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)
- Decrease peripheral insulin resistance
- Enhancing insulin action
- Skeletal muscle
- Liver
- Adipose tissue

Mechanism of action
- Binding and modulating the activity of a family of nuclear transcription factors
- Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARS)

- Shown an improvement of the androgen levels
- Ovulation rate
- Enhanced insulin sensitivity
- No reduction in the weight of subjects
- Decrease testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA
- Increase in SHBG
- Thereby causing a decrease in free testosterone levels
- Improvement in insulin sensitivity
- Improved both spontaneous and clomiphene-induced ovulation rates
- Independent effects on ovarian steroidogenesis
- Direct effect of TZD apart from improvement of insulin resistance?

IN SUMMARY

HST 071

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome

- PCOS women have higher circulating levels of inflammatory mediators
- C-reactive protein
- Tumor necrosis factor
- Tissue plasminogen activator
- Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)

- Hirsutism occurs in approximately 80% of PCOS women
- Documented by measuring androgen levels in the blood
- Free testosterone
- Total testosterone
- Androstenedione
- Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)

- In obese PCOS women
- Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels are decreased
- Leads to an increase in free testosterone levels
- Insulin is a negative regulator of the production of SHBG by the liver
- SHBG levels are decreased in hyperinsulinemic conditions
- Concentrations of sulfated DHEA (DHEAS) are also increased
- Secreted exclusively by the adrenal glands
- Mechanism of increased DHEAS production by the adrenals unknown
- Insulin ?
- IGF-1 ?

- Under influence of low but constant levels of FSH
- Multiple follicles of the ovary are stimulated
- Do not achieve maturation
- Lifespan of the follicles may extend over several months
- Leading to multiple follicular cysts
- Luteinized in response to constant and relatively high LH levels
- “arrested” follicles provide a constant supply of steroids
- Atretic follicle becomes an androgenic follicle
- Atretic follicles are deficient in aromatase activity

- Follicular cells from the small follicles of polycystic ovaries
- Produce small amounts of estradiol
- Show a dramatic increase in estrogen production when stimulated by FSH or IGF-1
- FSH therapy induces a larger cohort of follicles to develop in women with PCOS
- deficient in vivo ovarian response to FSH
- Due to impaired interaction between signaling pathways associated with FSH and IGF1 ?
