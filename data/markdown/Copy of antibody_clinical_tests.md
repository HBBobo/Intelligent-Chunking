Antibody-based Clinical Tests

Monday, February 11, 2008

- Isotype: antigenic determinant on an immunoglobulin that is expressed by all members of a species
- Inject a rabbit w/ a human immunoglobulin, determinants on constant region of the human antibody will be recognized as foreign
- Rabbit will make antibodies against them
- Rabbit antibodies recognize isotypic determinants and will react w/ Ig in the serum of virtually all humans

- Idiotype: antigenic determinant unique to a given Ig
- Used to describe complementarity determining regions to a given antibody
- Unique shape of epitope combining site made by the combination of the VH and VL hypervariable regions

- Many clinical tests use antibodies detect various proteins
- Affinity is dissociation constant for the single interaction w/ single Fab (impractical, unmeasurable)
- Avidity is interaction of multivalent antigen w/ multivalent antibody

- Immunoelectrophoresis
- Separation of proteins by charge
- Place serum from patient in one well, serum from normal individual in other well in middle of plate
- Turn on electric field and separate charged proteins
- Drop appropriate rabbit anti-human antisera from trough toward lane of fractionated serum proteins
- Antibodies in human serum detected as arcs of precipitation (where antigen=antibody)

- Agglutination
- Combine antigen w/ known antibodies and look for reaction
- A type blood w/ anti-A antibodies = reaction
- B + anti-A antibodies = no reaction

- ELISA
- Coat well w/ antibody anti-insulin epitope 1
- Introduce sample, if insulin present, it will bind to antibodies
- Wash off unbound material
- Add anti-insulin-alkaline phosphatase epitope 2
- If DNP changes from colorless --&gt; yellow, insulin is present

- Radioimmunoassays
- Use radiolabeled antigens or antibodies as competitive assay
- Clinical samples are used to compete for binding to antibodies w/ constant amount of radiolabeled standard
- Standard curve helps determine amount bound
- Results reported as positive/negative (50% bound is normal)
- Quantitites based on standard curve
- Titers (positive at dilution of 1:250, but not at 1:500)
- Amount of antibody against a particular pathogen should be zero or low in an individual who has never experienced that pathogen
- After recovery, amount in serum should be higher
- At height of infection, since not in effector phase, antibody in serum should be low
- Compare serum from patient tin active infection vs. convalescent serum
- Pathogen-specific antibody titers elevated when pt. is first seen w/ subacute/chronic infection or one w/ long incubation period

- Monoclonal Antibodies
- Mixture of serum antibodies in conventional (animal) antiserum is not perfect

Lecture Page 4

- Serum is a mixture of antibodies that represents all antigens ever encountered
- Each antigen w/ many epitopes results in the production of many antibodies in serum
- Some antibodies bind to antigen w/ low affinity, may bind related antigen w/ low affinity

○ Monoclonal antibodies solve most of the problems inherent in conventional antisera
- Spleen cells from mouse immunized w/ antigen A
- Myeloma cells lacking antibody secretion and HGPRT (makes cell susceptible to death by aminopterin)
- Spleen and myeloma cells fuse with PEG
- Transferred to HAT medium w/ aminopterin and immortal hybridomas proliferate
- Select hybridomas make antibody specific for antigen A
- Clone selected hybridomas

○ Supernatant of each hybridoma can be screened via ELISA for secretion of particular antibody
○ Advantages: immortal, monoclonal (specific), grown in large quantities
○ Uses: reagents for sandwich ELISA, detection of bacterial/viral antigens, tissue typing or analysis of CD expression, detection of virtually any protein
