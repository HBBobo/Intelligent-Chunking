# Measurement of Blood Pressure

- Comfortable sitting position
- Korotkoff V th sound should be used
- If the V th sound is not present, use the IV th but should note as such
- Some automated BP cuffs use the IV th sound
- In serial readings use the higher set of values
- Relative BP change of 30mmHg/15mmHg is no longer used as hypertension

"A disease of theories that have not stood the test of time"

1000 BC: First description of eclampsia is found in Kahun papyrus from Egypt
1800: An association between onset of hypertension and proteinuria and seizure during pregnancy was recognized
1950: A distinction between primary renal disease, chronic hypertension, epilepsy and preeclampsia/eclampsia became widely accepted

# EVIDENCE FOR TROPHOBLASTIC INVASION

Clinical
- Predisposing factors include
- Vascular disease (SLE, diabetes, chronic HBP)
- Multiple gestation
- Hydatidiform mole

Animal Studies
- Most successful models have induced utero-placental ischemia in rabbits, dogs and primates

Human Studies
- Histopathology of the placental bed
- Doppler of uterine artery

## VEGF
- ☐ Promotes angiogenesis
- ☐ Induces nitric oxide and prostacyclin
- ☐ Glomerular healing

## Anti-VEGF
- ☐ Increases apoptosis
- ☐ Impairs glomerular capillary repair
- ☐ Increases proteinuria in rat model of messangio-proliferative nephritis
- ☐ Increases proteinuria in experimental thrombotic microangiopathy

[Structure of sVEGFR-1 (sFlt-1).]

First described by Kendall et al.(1993) and has been localized to trophoblast by Clark et al.1998.
Has been shown to be produced in greater amount in trophoblasts isolated from preeclampsia (Zhou et al. 2002)
Its role in distal organs and in various pathologic state is unknown
Hypoxia may increase its production in trophoblast
