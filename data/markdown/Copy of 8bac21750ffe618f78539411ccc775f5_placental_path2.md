# IN SUMMARY

# TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE

# TROPHOBLASTIC NEOPLASIA

## Types of trophoblast neoplasia

- Molar (always gestational)
- villi
- Non-molar (can be non-gestational)
- No villi
- Molar gestations
- Errors in fertilization or meiosis
- Abnormal paternal contribution to the zygote
- Two categories:
- Complete hydatidiform mole
- Partial hydatidiform mole

## Partial Hydatidiform Mole

- Excess tissue:
- Occasionally large villi are grossly identifiable but should be &lt; 1cm in greatest dimension
- Fetal development is possible with characteristic anomalies:
- IUGR
- 3-4 syndactyly - hands
- 2-3 syndactyly - feet
- Renal, cardiac, neural structural anomalies
- Histology:
- Two populations villi - large + cisterns, small
- Irregular outlines of villi
- Villous syncytiotrophoblastic inclusions
- Excess and atypical villous syncytiotrophoblast
- "molar" implantation site
- Embryonic/fetal development
- Characterized by focal villous hydrops
- Focal trophoblastic hyperppasia
- Two populations of villi
- large and hydropic
- background of small, sclerotic and normal-sized villi
- scalloped villous outlines
- tangential sectioning of the villi results in stromal trophoblastic inclusions
- villous surfaces may have many tiny projections of syncytiotrophoblast forming notches
- Focal trophoblast hyperplasia
- Mounds of syncytiotrophoblast
- Nuclear atypia infrequent
- Villi vessels contain nucleated RBS and often fetal tissue found
- Triploid
- Extra haploid DNA is paternal

IN SUMMARY
TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE
HST 071

## Complete hydatidiform mole
- Villi grossly identifiable, often &gt;1cm in greatest dimension
- No fetal development
- Excess tissue
- Villous hydrops
- Trophoblast hyperplasia
- Cistern formation
- Blood vessels lacking
- Mounds of mitotic cytotrophoblast
- Lacy proliferation of syncitiotrophoblast
- Extravillous trophoblast
- Cytologic atypia
- Diploid
- Nuclear DNA androgenically derived

## Molar gestations
- Complete moles - choriocarcinoma, recurrence
- Partial moles - rarely persist
- Imprinting
- Molar gestations are evidence of difference between maternal and paternal DNA
- Molar pregnancies are due to a overabundance of paternal DNA
- Paternal DNA preferentially makes extraembryonic
- Maternal DNA preferentially makes embryonic tissues

## Choriocarcinoma
- Malignancy of all trophoblast lineages
- Gestational or non-gestational
- Presents with bleeding, toxemia
- Widely metastatic
- Gestational is chemosensitive
- Followed with bHCG and imaging
- Histology of choriocarcinoma
- Biphasic trophoblast
- Hemorrhage and necrosis

## Choriocarcinoma in situ
- Can present as mass-like lesions in the placenta
- Can cross the placenta to metastasize to fetus
- Silent at placental presentation or widely metastatic

IN SUMMARY
TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE
HST 071

## Placental site trophoblastic tumor
- Neoplasm of intermediate trophoblast
- Locally invasive, rare metastases
- Mild symptoms of persistent pregnancy
- No good serum markers
- Therapy is hysterectomy

## Histology of PSTT
- Mono or binucleate trophoblast
- Pushing border
- Massachusetts

## FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS
1. Define gestational trophoblastic disease.
2. Describe the histology of a complete mole. A partial mole.
3. What is the karyotypes of a complete mole? A partial mole?
4. What is the malignant potential of the partial mole? The complete mole?
5. How does one follow a patient who has had a molar pregnancy?
6. What is the treatment for persistent trophoblastic disease?
