# Functional classification of Cell junctions

## Occluding junctions

## Anchoring junctions

- Actin filament attachment sites
- Cell to cell (adhesion belts)
- Cell to matrix (focal contact)
- Intermediate filament attachment sites
- Cell to cell desmosomes
- Cell-matrix (hemidesmosomes)

## Communicating junctions

- Gap junctions
- Chemical synapses
- Plasmodesmata (plants only)

# The gap junction

- 2 plasma membranes connected by a series of structures made up of connexons
- connexon has six subunits
- 2 connexons in register forming open channels between the two membranes
- Channel is 1.5 nm in diameter
- Gap between membranes is 2-4 nm
- Electrical resistance is determined by number of junctions that are expressed
- Resistance (measure of gap junction density)
- 100 ohm/cm non-pregnant
- 50 ohm/cm at term
- 100 ohm/cm for stomach
- 250 ohm/cm for taenia caeci
- 400 ohm/cm for bladder
- Junctions increase at time of parturition
- Connexin-43 has high turnover rate in labor
- Estradiol and oxytocin increase levels
- Progesterone and hCG decrease levels

# Signaling in myometrium

- Action potentials = electro-mechanical coupling
- Receptor stimulation = pharmaco-mechanical coupling
- Hormones
- Oxytocin, epinephrine
- Classic transmitters
- 5-HT, acetylcholine
- Lipid mediators
- prostanoids

# Role of calcium

- Good temporal relationship between intracellular Ca++ and development of force
- Ca++-calmodulin activate myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)
- This phosphorylates a serine residue (Ser 19) in the 20 kDa light chain of myosin (MLC20)
- Phosphorylated myosin interacts with actin and causes a contraction
- When Ca++ is removed phosphorylation ceases and the muscle relaxes

# Oxytocin

- Nonapeptide as shown
- First peptide ever synthesized - Nobel Prize
- High affinity, low capacity receptors
- 80-fold increase in number by term
- marked increase in sensitivity
- Act by raising intracellular free calcium levels
- Calcium stimulates actomyosin formation and muscular contraction
- Maternal and fetal source
- High affinity, low capacity receptors
- 80-fold increase in number by term
- marked increase in sensitivity
- Act by raising intracellular free calcium levels
- Calcium stimulates actomyosin formation and muscular contraction
- Maternal and fetal source

# Uterus

Oxytocin receptors distributed in a gradient from fundus (maximum) to cervix (few)
Receptor concentration begins to rise early in pregnancy and exponentially increases to term

# Prostaglandins

- Prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxane
- Products of arachidonic acid metabolism.
- Produce numerous physiologic and pathophysiologic effects
- Regulating cellular processes in nearly every tissue
- Local hormones
- act in the vicinity of their site of production
- Function in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner
- Widely distributed
- Can be formed by nearly every tissue and cell type
- Ability to provoke different responses in various tissues
- Five physiologically important prostanoids
- PGE2
- PGF2a
- PGI2
- TXA2
- PGE2
- Wide spectrum of physiological and pharmacological actions
- Immune
- Endocrine
- Cardiovascular
- Renal
- Reproductive
- Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle
- Exert their effects through GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled, rhodopsin-type receptors
- Receptors for PGE2 are termed EP, which include EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 subtypes
- High specific PGE2 binding has been observed in the brain, kidney, uterus, liver, thymus and the adrenal medulla
- PGE2 has versatile and opposing actions due to multiple EP receptor subtypes and the coupling of EP receptor isoforms to a variety of signal transduction pathways

# G-proteins

- adrenaline
- glucagon
- luteinizing hormone (LH)
- parathyroid hormone (PTH)
- adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
- prostaglandins
- Evidence suggests
- PGE2 affects gene transcription
- Regulates growth and cell proliferation.
- Endogenous PGE2 regulates the growth of epithelial cells
- PGE2 exhibits mitogenic activities in bone cells and stimulates DNA synthesis
- PGE2 is involved in the growth and metastasis of tumors
- Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis has been shown to result in growth retardation of tumors in experimental animals
- Decreased risk of colon cancer with ASA

# Cervical Collagen

- Major protein of the extracellular matrix
- 25% of mammalian protein
- Stiff triple stranded helical structure
- α chains (1000 amnio acids long)
- Proline and glycine bonds create the left handed helical configuration
- More than 20 types of collagen
- I, II, III are fibrillar collagens
- Assemble into fibrils and then fibers

- Collagen polypeptides formed on membrane bound ribosomes and injected into the ER as pro-α chains (have extra amnio-acids called pro-peptides at ends)
- In lumen of ER hydroxyproline allows bonding of three pro-α chains to form procollagen
- Propeptides of type I, II, and III removed by extracellular enzymes converting them to tropocollagen (1.5 nm diameter)
- Tropocollagen assembles to form fibrils (10-200 nm)
- Type I and type III
- Spaces between bundles dilate @ 8-14 weeks
- Total collagen increases but concentration goes down 30-50%
- Water and non-collagen proteins increase
- Fibrils decrease in size
- Stains for collagen polymer show reduced amount (lower numbers of intact fibers)
- Spaces between bundles dilate @ 8-14 weeks
- Total collagen increases but concentration goes down 30-50%
- Water and non-collagen proteins increase
- Fibrils decrease in size
- Stains for collagen polymer show reduced amount (lower numbers of intact fibers)

# Ground substance

- Glucosamine - naturally occurring amino sugar found in glycosoaminoglycans (mucopolysaccharides)
- Integral components of the proteoglycans
- Proteoglycans - large carbohydrate rich structures
- Resiliency
- Load distribution
- Shock-absorbing
- Compressive
- Lubricating
- Dietary glucosamine
- An immediate precursor for glycosaminoglycan synthesis
- Stimulates incorporation of other precursors into the connective tissue matrix

- GAG (glycosaminoglycan)
- Total increases throughout pregnancy
- Concentration remains constant
- Helps loosen the collagen network

- HA (hyaluronic acid)
- Increases 12 fold at 2-3 cm dilation
- HA may bind water and help hydration of tissue and hence deformability

- CS (chondroitin sulfate)
- Decrease
- Results in decreased rigidity of cervical tissue

- Elastase acts on the telopeptide non-helical domains of collagen
