# SALIVARY GLANDS

1. Saliva produced by three major and a number of minor glands
2. Glands are acinar-ductal in structure
3. Made up of Serous and Mucus Acinar Cells, Duct Cells, and Myoepithelial Cells

# Contents of Saliva

$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$

Ions  $(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-})$

Enzymes
Amylase

Antibacterial
Compounds
Lysozyme
Lactoferrin
IGA

Mucus

# Function of Saliva

1. Lubrication of food - mucins
2. Partial digestion of polysaccharides - amylase
3. Moisten mouth and wash away dissolved food (necessary for taste)
4. Mild antibacterial - lysozyme, lactoferrin
5. Neutralize acids in food and regurgitated stomach acid
6. Maintenance of teeth - $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, fluoride

# SALIVARY GLANDS

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Rate: basal - 0.25 ml/min
max - 5 - 10 ml/min
typical - 1.0 - 1.5 liters/day
Osmolarity: hyptonic
pH: alkaline
Major Proteins: alpha amylase (ptyalin) mucins

PD-ENEL

Oral
mechano- &amp; chemoreceptors (chewing, acids)
Intestinal &amp; central chemoreceptors (vomiting)

Minor: Sympathetic
Major: Parasympathetic

# Fluid Flow Model for Production of Saliva

hypotonic, alkaline solution, with high K

# SALIVARY PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

**Xerostomia** - the condition of dry mouth resulting from the absence of saliva

Can be due to Sjogrens Syndrome, radiation damage or as a side effect of certain drugs

Absence of saliva leads to tooth decay, infections and discomfort

# REGULATION OF THE LOWER ESOPHAGEAL SPHINCHTER

1. LES contraction regulated by intrinsic properties of smooth muscle, nerves and hormones
2. Basal tone is myogenic but increased by ACh and Gastrin
3. Transient relaxation mediated by inhibitory neurons that use VIP or NO as a neurotransmitter
4. Sphincter tone lacking in newborns and decreased during pregnancy

# ABNORMALITIES OF LES

1. Failure of LES to function as a sphincter leads to reflux esophagitis or "heartburn"
2. GERD – Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
3. Failure to relax results in “Achalasia”
