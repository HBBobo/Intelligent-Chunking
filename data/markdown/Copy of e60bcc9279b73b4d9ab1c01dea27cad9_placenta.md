# IN SUMMARY PLACENTATION

# PLACENTA

## General facts

- Mammalian organ vital for fetal life
- Acts as interface between fetal and maternal environments
- Source of pregnancy-associated hormones and growth factors
- Protects the fetal "allograft" from maternal immune system

## Development of the human placenta

- The placenta forms from zygotic tissues and the first cell type to differentiate is the trophoblast
- By the end of the third week the placenta is functioning
- The human placental cell types include:
- Cytotrophoblast
- Synctiotrophoblast
- Intermediate trophoblast
- Stroma - macrophages (Hofbauer cells), fibrocytes, Wharton's jelly
- Vascular structure - endothelium

## Implantation

- After ovulation
- glands become tortuous
- spiral arteries form
- endometrium thickens
- pinopods, microvilli, apical protrusions present at 20-23 days
- implantation occurs during this time
- pinopods
- absorb molecules and fluid from lumen
- increase apposition of embryo and endometrium
- reduce potential cavity
- Ovum captured in distal portion of tube
- Fertilization occurs
- Enters uterus 4 days after ovulation
- Cleavage occurs during these 4 days but no change in size (no cell growth) - 150um
- Inner cell mass --&gt; embryo
- Trophoblast ---&gt; placenta
- Cell growth then begins
- Invasion
- between uterine epithelium (intrusive penetration)
- ferret, guinea pig, rhesus monkey
- replace epithelial cells (displacement penetration)
- mouse, rat
- fuse with epithelial cells (fusion penetration)
- rabbits
- Human mode unknown but probably intrusive
- attaches to epithelium and heads for decidua
- Cytotrophoblasts fuse to form syncytium
- Penetration continues for 4 days
- Stroma undergoes changes (not just displaced)
- Implantation occurs 7-8 days after ovulation

# IN SUMMARY PLACENTATION

- Embryo "targets" hypoepithelial vessels on surface of endometrium
- Surface is made receptive for the embryo
- Immediate
- human
- Delayed
- facultative (rat, red kangaroo only during stress)
- facultative (Alaska fur seal, mink, bear always)
- free floating morula/blastocyst with min. met. act.
- Light cycle control duration of delay

## Immature Chorionic Villi

Trophoblast cell types
- Cytotrophoblast
- Stem cell
- Mononuclear/euploid
- epithelial
- Intermediate trophoblast
- Invasive/implantation site cell
- Mono-multinucleate
- hPL &gt; hCG
- proteases
- Syncytiotrophoblast
- Terminally differentiated
- Polynucleated-polyploid
- hCG &gt; hPL
- transport
- Murine placental development
- E3.5 trophectoderm (epithelial cells) differentiates:
- Extraembryonic ectoderm
- Extrapalacental cone
- Trophoblast giant cells

## Trophectoderm differentiation

- Control over the initial cell fate decision is unclear
- After blastocoel forms, signalling between the ICM and the trophectoderm are critical
- Fgf4/Fgfr2

IN SUMMARY PLACENTATION

## Early trophectoderm differentiation

- Trophectoderm spatially most distant from ICM become TGC
- ICM expresses Fgf4, trophectoderm expressed Fgfr2
- Fgf4 ko embryos are lethal YET Fgf4 -/- stem cells are viable
- Oct4 ko lack ICM but make trophectoderm if Fgf4 given
- Fgfr dominant negative constructs block trophoblast proliferation
- Trophoblast “stem cells” require Fgf4, withdrawn will differentiate to TGC

## Branching

- As the trophoblast grows it branches and increases its surface area
- Molecules involved in this process are same as involved in branching morphogenesis in other organs (e.g. lung, kidney)
- Initiation of branching - Gcm1
- Branching morphogenesis - Fgf and others downstream/ signal transduction: Grb2, Gab1, Sos1 Mek1
- Wnt canonical pathway via Tcf1 and Lef1

## Vasculogenesis

- Coordination of vascular pattern with villous pattern varies amongst species
- Murine the events are simultaneous
- In human, the villi form first then vessels “come in”
- Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are key
- Trophoblast factor - Esx1
- Hypoxia inducible factors important
- Hif1b1
- Vegf
- Epas

## Immunobiology of pregnancy

- Mother’s immune system has to protect the mother and fetus against pathogens and prevent the rejection of the semi-allergeneic feto-placental unit
- Potential for repeated pregnancies with same paternity potentially triggering immune memory
- Innate vs Adaptive Immunity
- Fetal alloantigens are recognized by maternal adaptive immune system
- Innate immune response during implantation involves complement activation and neutrophil infiltration
- Controlled complement activation
- Complement regulatory proteins prevent overdrive of complement activation in successful pregnancies
- Complement mediated cell lysis is regulated by factors:
- DAF/CD55
- MCP/CD46
- Crry

IN SUMMARY
PLACENTATION

## Complement

- C3 deposition at maternal-fetal interface results in hemorrhagic necrosis and neutrophil infiltration leading to fetal resorption
- Crry -/- abort
- Crry -/- crossed with C3 -/- produce viable fetuses
- C3 deficient mothers have no fetal injury even when injected with aPL which results in antibody deposition in the decidua
- T-Cell dependent inflammation inhibited by IDO
- Tryptophan is needed for cell proliferation and is lower in pregnant than in non-pregnant women
- IDO degrades tryptophan
- IDO is expressed by syncytiotrophoblast, macrophages, and antigen presenting cells
- Macrophages suppress T cell activity due to degradation of tryptophan by IDO
- Treatment with an IDO inhibitor leads to inflammation, complement deposition and hemorrhagic necrosis at fetomaternal interface

## Role of HLA-G

- Nonclassical HLA class I molecule expressed in trophoblasts, amnion, and thymic epithelial cells
- 7 distinct protein isoforms each encoded by a specific alternatively spliced transcript
- 4 are membrane bound and 3 are soluble
- Inhibit NK cell mediated cytolysis and Ag specific CD8+ T cell mediated cytolysis HLA-G and Implantation
- Normally highly expressed by invading trophoblast
- Greatly reduced in trophoblasts from spontaneous abortions and in patients with preeclampsia
- Zygotic expression of soluble HLA-G is required for blastocyst attachment

## Adhesion molecules

- Integrins
- cell to cell adhesion receptors
- cell-to-cell matrix reactions
- 21 different types
- anchor cells to specific locations
- transmit information to cells
- Immunologic homing
- Metastatic spread
- Healing

IN SUMMARY PLACENTATION

-Heterodimers composed of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits
-Ligand specificity a function of $\alpha\beta$ heterodimer
-May bind to several ligands
-Ligand may bind to several heterodimers

- constitutively expressed
- phasic and hormonally regulated
- infertility? Related to reduced endometrial expression of $\beta_{3}$
- defect in embryonic expression of $\beta_{1}$ causes involution of inner cell mass but preserves trophoblast
- polarity

- Distribution of the integrins either promotes or retards attachment
- Switching

- Early trophoblast exhibits $\alpha_{5}\beta_{1}$ but later changes to $\alpha_{1}\beta_{1}$
- May regulate invasiveness
