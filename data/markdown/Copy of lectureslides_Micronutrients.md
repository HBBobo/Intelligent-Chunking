# ESSENTIAL MINERAL ELEMENTS

1. Required to maintain normal physiology and health
2. Occur in diet, sometimes as trace elements
3. Variable absorptions may be regulated
4. In steady state intestinal absorption equals body losses

# MINERAL ABSORPTION BY SMALL INTESTINE IS AFFECTED BY:

1. Intraluminal pH
2. Redox state of metals
3. Formation of chelates to enhance solubility
4. Formation of insoluble complexes

# IRON

1. Essential for oxidative energy metabolism and DNA synthesis
2. Body stores contain about 4 g with 2.5 g in red blood cells
3. To maintain a balance, the gut absorbs 1-2 mg/day from dietary supply of 10-20 mg

# CELLULAR IRON HOMEOSTASIS

1. All cells take up iron-transferrin from plasma by transferrin receptor endocytosis.
2. Iron is stored intracellularly complexed to the binding protein ferritin.
3. Iron regulatory proteins function as cytoplasmic iron sensors and increase Tf Receptors by stabilizing mRNA when more iron is needed.
4. Efflux from cells such as macrophages is by ferroportin.

# IRON ABSORPTION

1. Dietary iron present as heme (minor) and nonheme iron compounds (major).
2. Nonheme iron in the Fe³⁺ ferric state requires gastric acid for solubilization.
3. Fe³⁺ mainly reduced to Fe²⁺ (ferrous) prior to absorption.
4. Iron absorption occurs primarily in the duodenum and upper jejunum.

# NEW PROTEINS INVOLVED IN IRON ABSORPTION

Ferrireductase Apical membrane enzyme to reduce iron

DMT-1 Divalent Metal Transporter-1
Apical Membrane Iron Transport

Ferroportin-1 Iron Export Carrier on the Basolateral Membrane

Hephaestin Basolateral membrane protein which facilitates the transport of iron out of cells

# Role of Liver in Regulating Iron Absorption

1. Liver is main storage site for excess iron
2. Hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide secreted by hepatocytes which it acts as an inhibitor of iron absorption by the gut and release from macrophages.
3. Production of hepcidin is decreased by iron deficiency and increased with iron loading and inflammation
4. Hepacidin interacts directly with ferroportin leading to its degradation. This leads to decreased iron absorption and release

# CAUSES OF IRON DEFICIENCY

1. Dietary Deficiency
2. Excess phytate or oxylate in diet
3. Gastric achlorhydria
4. Hookworm infestation
5. Excessive bleeding

# CONSEQUENCES OF IRON DEFICIENCY

1. Anemia (microcytic, hypochromic)
2. Poor growth in children
3. Impaired energy metabolism

# HEREDITY HEMOCHROMATOSIS

1. Common form is autosomal recessive with gene frequency as high as 1 in 10 in individuals of Northern European descent
2. Excessive mucosal iron absorption relative to need
3. Clinical manifestations are a result of iron deposition in liver, heart, pancreas and joints
4. &gt;80% of patients have a single mutation in HFE protein which leads to decreased plasma hepcidin

# ABSORPTION OF VITAMINS

1. Water soluble vitamins
- facilitated diffusion (Na+-coupled)
2. Fat soluble vitamins
- absorbed same as other lipids
3. Vitamin B₁₂
- special receptor
- requires intrinsic factor

# WATER SOLUBLE VITAMINS

Thiamine  Pyridoxine  Folate
Riboflavin  Pantothenate  Cobalamin (B₁₂)
Niacin  Biotin  Ascorbic Acid

Generally metabolized to forms acting as coenzymes

Vit C functions as a water soluble antioxidant

# FOLATE DEFICIENCY

1. Folates function as coenzymes in 1 carbon transfers; important in nucleic acid synthesis and amino acid metabolism
2. Deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia and growth retardation
3. Recent studies show a relationship to neuronal tube birth defects
PHS recommends women of childbearing age consume 400 µg daily

Polyglutamyl folates must be hydrolyzed to the monoglutamyl form before absorption

A specific enzyme, folate conjugase, is involved which is inhibited by ethanol and some drugs (Dilantin, sulfasalazine)

Absorption is by a saturable mechanism involving a folic acid: OH⁻ exchange mechanism

Within enterocyte folic acid is reduced and methylated

# FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS

A – Retinol, carotenoids
D – Cholecalciferol (D₃); Ergosterol (D₂)
E – α-Tocopherol
K – Phylloquinone (K₁); Menaquinones (K₂)

# VITAMIN E

1. The major lipid soluble antioxidant in plasma and cell membranes
2. Dietary Sources are vegetable oils, wheat germ, nuts, green leafy vegetables. Recommended intake 15 mg/day
3. Absorption varies from 10-80% by passive diffusion and packaging into chylomicrons
4. Role in therapy unclear (macular degeneration, cardiovascular disease, prostate cancer)

# VITAMIN K

1. Biological function is to serve as a cofactor for essential post-translational modifications essential for certain proteins including blood clotting factors
2. Dietary form (K₁) most abundant in green leafy vegetables
3. Insoluble in water; requires bile salts for absorption
4. Importance of bacterially derived K₂ controversial but prevents severe deficiency in humans unless colonic flora absent

# Vitamin A Family

Retinoids present in liver, milk, eggs

Carotenoids present in carrots and green leafy vegetables

# DISORDERS OF VITAMIN A HOMEOSTATIS

1. Vitamin A deficiency results in xeropthalmia; initially night blindness can progress to total blindness
2. Deficiency also increases susceptibility to infection
3. Recommended daily intake of 1000 µg retinol or 6000 ug beta carotene
4. Hypervitaminosis most commonly due to self-medication; can result in signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, skin lesions and hepatic injury
