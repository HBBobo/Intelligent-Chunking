# How to get the most out of your intestine

Start with a long tube

Convolute the absorptive surface of the tube

Add enzymes that break down luminal contents

Keep the tube moving, mix contents

# Enzymes/bile digest luminal contents:

"Chyme" enters from stomach, stimulates intestinal enteroendocrine cells in intestine to secrete:
- Secretin → pancreatic secretion
- CCK (cholecystokinin) → pancreatic secretion
→ gall bladder contraction

*Ampulla of Vater*: intestinal segment of the common duct that delivers secretions to duodenum
- from pancreas (trypsin*, chymotrypsin*, amylase, lipase)
- from liver via gall bladder (bile-emulsifies fat)

Enzymes in small intestinal absorptive cell (enterocyte) membrane complete the process of digestion and absorb the breakdown products

*Secreted as inactive forms, activated by enterokinase cleavage (enterokinase produced in duodenum)*

# Enzymes/bile digest luminal contents: activation of zymogens via enterokinase/trypsin

# GALT: Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue
(approximately 1/4 of mucosa)

- Plasma cells, macrophages, lymphocytes located in lamina propria and submucosa
- Also “intraepithelial” lymphocytes – specialized T cells found between columnar epithelial cells
- Lymph nodules (or follicles): aggregations of lymphocytes usually in lamina propria, sometimes extending into submucosa
- activated leukocytes go to nearby lymph nodes, activate T+B cells, which “home” to GI mucosa.
- plasma cells develop from activated B cells in follicles and migrate into lamina propria to secrete antibodies (secretory IgA, which can be selectively transported across enterocytes into the gut lumen)
- “Peyer’s patches:” large aggregates of nodules (technically this term applies to aggregates found in ileum)
- covered by M cells (specialized for uptake &amp; presentation of antigen to underlying macrophages and lymphoid cells)
