# Objectives

To understand:
- How cells and tissues are arranged in the normal organ system of the body, and
- How these cells and tissues are specialized to perform the function(s) most effectively.

The knowledge gained will hopefully provide a cellular and ultrastructural “framework” for all of the other topics (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc.) that you’ll learn this year.

Histology is also, of course, a FUNDAMENTAL part of PATHOLOGY.

a.k.a. Micro-anatomy

# Tissue Preparation for Light Microscopy

1. Stabilize cellular structures by chemical fixation.
3. Dehydrate and infiltrate tissues with paraffin or plastic.
5. Embed fixed tissues in paraffin or plastic blocks.
7. Cut into thin slices of 3-10 micrometer thick; collect sections on slides.
9. Re-hydrate and stain with Hematoxylin (a basic dye): Stains basophilic structures (e.g. nucleic acids) blue/purple.
11. Counter-stain with Eosin (an acidic dye): Stains acidophilic or “eosinophilic” structures (e.g. proteins, membranes) red/pink.

“H &amp; E” staining is routine, but other dyes and staining techniques may be used to visualize other structures.

# Tissue Preparation for Electron Microscopy

1. Tissues are fixed with glutaraldehyde (cross-links proteins) and osmium tetraoxide (cross-links lipids); OsO₄ is also an electron-dense "stain"
2. Dehydrate and infiltrate tissues w/ plastic.
3. Embed and block fixed tissues in plastic.
4. Cut into ultra-thin slices (50 nanometers thick); collect sections on slides.
5. Stain sections with heavy metal salts (lead citrate and uranyl acetate) that bind nucleic acids &amp; proteins.
6. Visualize in TEM; heavy metal "stains" block electrons to create contrast

# Virtual Microscopy

- Glass microscope slides line-scanned using a computer-controlled microscope
- Line scans compiled into single "digital slide" that may be 200k x 200k pixels (that's 40 GIGApixels!)
- Digital slides stored as compressed files (~1.5 GB) and delivered via Web or file-server
- Digital slides viewable as flash objects within web browser or in proprietary format (e.g. Aperio ImageScope)
- Any region of interest on digital slide may be viewed at a range of magnifications with resolution up to 0.25µm/pixel

Before you begin:

1. Turn off wireless and connect to network with ethernet cable.
2. Map network drive (Windows only - click on the link and select "Run").
3. If you have problems, try shut down/restart.

## OBJECTIVES:

1. Be able to recognize the three major cartilage types in typical light microscopic sections.
2. Be able to use standard nomenclature to describe a section of cartilage (e.g. chondrocyte, lacuna, matrix, perichondrium).
3. Understand the molecular basis for resilience of cartilages.
4. Be able to recognize forming (embryonic) cartilage.
5. Be able to describe the process of chondrogenesis.

1. Hyaline cartilage (W pg 187, 10.1; pg 239, 12.8) hyalce = glass (Greek)

# Microscopes and glass slides still have their place!

- The focal plane and depth-of-field (aperture) of the digital slide is fixed
- The digital slide is only a representative specimen
- Servers crash
- Knowing how to use a microscope has its value.

# Quizzes and Exams

- Usually a total of 8 questions per session divided between weekly quizzes and final exam. Questions will weigh equally.
- Weekly quizzes and final exams will all be administered online.
- Multiple choice questions: some straight text, but MOSTLY image-based (LM, EM, or diagram), or virtual slides
- Sample questions may be found in the online syllabus.

# So, what's going to happen in the lab today?

It depends on how you look at it…

# Tasks in the lab today…

- Making sure your computers are set up to access and view virtual slides
- Explanation of the different links to the virtual slides:
- “Mac” (for Macs that cannot run Windows)
- “WinLab” (for Windows machines when ON CAMPUS)
- “WinHome” (for Windows machines OFF CAMPUS)
- “Load testing” the servers (requires synchronized activity, so wait for instructions)
- After load testing, work through tutorial to learn basic features of ImageScope (Windows) and WebViewer (non-Windows)
- Sign and turn in Loan Agreement Forms acknowledging receipt of network cable (we’ll deal with microscopes and slides NEXT week)

# A quick word about ImageScope…

- It is the preferred method of viewing the slides
- Primary advantage is the ability to ANNOTATE slides (for self-study or to mark something about which you have a question)
- Slides are opened into ONE ImageScope window so it's easy to quickly go from one slide to another and/or compare slides side-by-side
- Can adjust image brightness, contrast, and color levels
- 1-click TIFF or JPEG image capture
