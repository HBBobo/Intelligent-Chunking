# Myocardial Ischemia (MI)

- blood flow to a tissue or organ (heart) that is
inadequate to maintain function.

5

# Heart statistics

300g / 70,000g = 0.0043 or &lt; 0.5% Body Weight.

Heart consumes more energy than any other organ.

Coronary flow = 4% of cardiac output.

“Resting” flow 30X flow/g tissue of skeletal muscle.

**Highest oxygen consumption per g of tissue in body.**

(arterial oxygen 20 Vol % to coronary sinus 8 Vol %)

(typical mixed venous oxygen higher at 17 Vol %)

***SEE SLIDE 37 &amp; 38 FOR SUMMARY OF OTHER TISSUES

**Must increase coronary blood flow to increase oxygen delivery.**

Vol % = mL O₂ / 100mL blood

# Pressure X Rate Product

Thus an enlarged heart has greater demand.

With the same perfusion pressure, the same measured flow means the overall (series) resistance is the same regardless of a focal lesion!

# TISSUE VASCULAR RESISTANCE
(***Assume Perfusion Pressure is Constant ***)

- Vasoconstriction $\Rightarrow \Downarrow$ r $\Rightarrow \uparrow$ R_tissue
$\Rightarrow \Downarrow$ F_tissue

- Vasodilation
$\Rightarrow \uparrow$ r $\Rightarrow \Downarrow$ R_tissue $\Rightarrow \uparrow$ F_tissue

$$
F_{\text{tissue}} = \frac{\text{Perfusion Pressure}}{\text{R}_{\text{tissue}}} = \text{Coronary flow}
$$

# "Flow" vs. "Perfusion"

- Angiography
- Large surface
- "Focal"
- "Fixed" diameter
- Bypass
- Stent

- Nuc. Imaging
- Arteriolar
- Vasodilator reserve
- Functional flow
- Distributed resistance
- Collateral channels

# Intrinsic Regulation of Coronary Blood Flow

“Thus any additional oxygen requirement must be met by an increase in blood flow.”

P 143 Lilly

You must use vasodilator reserve --- assuming you have any left!

# BUT HOW DOES IT WORK IN VIVO ???

## Parasympathetic Activation

Stimulate parasympathetic to heart &gt;&gt; Ach &gt;&gt; SA node
&gt;&gt; ↓↓ HR &gt;&gt; ↓↓ metabolism &gt;&gt; ↓↓ Coronary Blood flow

BUT

PACE heart (i.e. fixed heart rate) &gt;&gt; no change in HR &gt;&gt; no change metabolism --- Therefore
Stimulate parasympathetic to paced heart &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ach vasodilation &gt;&gt; ↑↑ coronary blood flow !!

# BUT HOW DOES IT WORK IN VIVO ???

## Sympathetic Activation

Stimulate sympathetic nerves to heart &gt;&gt; ↑↑ Norepi &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ↑↑ HR + ↑↑ inotropism &gt;&gt; ↑↑ metabolism &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ↑↑ ↑↑ Coronary Blood flow

## BUT

Block β₁&amp;₂ receptors and Stimulate sympathetics to heart &gt;&gt; ↑↑ Norepi (stress) &gt;&gt; no change in HR &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no change inotropism &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no change in metabolism &gt;&gt; potential for &gt;&gt; ↓↓ Coronary Blood flow

lated that in normal individuals, the relaxation effect of EDRF-NO outweighs the direct $\alpha$-adrenergic constrictor effect of catecholamines on arterial smooth muscle, such that vasodilatation results. However, in patients with dysfunctional endothelium (e.g., atherosclerosis), an impaired release of endothelial vasodilators leaves the direct catecholamine effect unopposed, such that relative vasoconstriction occurs instead. The resultant decrease in coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply contributes to ischemia. Of note, in patients with risk factors

# Asymmetric Dimethylarginine Independently Predicts Fatal and Nonfatal Myocardial Infarction and Stroke in Women
## 24-Year Follow-Up of the Population Study of Women in Gothenburg

Tora Leong, Dimitri Zylberstein, Ian Graham, Lauren Lissner, Deirdre Ward, Jane Fogarty, Calle Bengtsson, Cecilia Björkelund, Dag Thelle; for The Swedish-Irish-Norwegian (SIN) Collaboration

**Objective**—Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) reduces nitric oxide by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our study examined the association of ADMA with CVD prospectively in a healthy population-based cohort of women.

**Methods and Results**—We measured baseline ADMA of 880 women in the Population Study of Women in Gothenburg using high-performance liquid chromatography. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, creatinine clearance, and homocysteine using Cox models, the HR (95% CI in parentheses) of CVD end points at 24 years for a 0.15 μmol/L (1 SD) increase in ADMA were: all-cause mortality 1.12 (0.96, 1.32), fatal CVD 1.30 (1.04, 1.62), total CVD events 1.29 (1.09, 1.53). The top quintile (ADMA ≥0.71 μmol/L) compared with the bottom four-fifths, conferred a cumulative risk 22 versus 14%, relative risk 1.75 (95% CI 1.18, 2.59) and population attributable risk 12.7% of total CVD events, and further identified individuals who are at higher than expected risk based on the SCORE and Framingham systems.

**Conclusions**—A 0.15 μmol/L increase in baseline ADMA levels is associated with approximately 30% increase in incident cardiovascular risk at 24 years in women after adjustment. ADMA levels ≥0.71 μmol/L enhances CVD risk assessment in women. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 2008;28:961-967)
