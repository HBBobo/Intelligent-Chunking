The MHC Complex

- Diversity
- Not as diverse as TCR or antibodies
- Purpose is to increase range of peptides that can be presented to T cells
- Diversity w/in population has major medical implications (organ transplantation)
- Basis of Diversity
- Genes are stable and not rearranged
- Polygeny - each individual has multiple genes that encode for class I heavy and class II α and β chains
- Polymorphism - for each MHC gene there are many different variants w/in population
- MHC Genes
- On human chromosome 6
- MHC locus is so called b/c genetic polymorphisms encoded in this region identified as principal cause of graft rejection btwn individuals
- Aka HLA complex
- Polygeny
- Six MHC class I heavy chain genes - HLA-A through G
- A,B,C involved in presentation of antigens - many alleles
- E and G expression may prevent attack by NK cells which recognize and kill class I negative targets
- F fxn unknown
- ☐ Remember β2 is invariant
- Class II - DM, DO, DP, DQ, DR
- ☐ DP, Q, R involved in antigen presentation
- ☐ Number of DRB genes is variable (can have two)
- HLA-DR is most variable along w/ HLA-A,B,C
- Haplotypes
- Particular combination of alleles
- HLA expressed co-dominantly so heterozygotes express two haplotypes
- Can express as few as 3 class I and 3 class II molecules or as many as 6 and 8, respectively
- ☐ Homozygote: HLA-A, B, C, DP, DQ, DR X 1 = 3 class I, 3 class II
- ☐ Heterozygote: HLA-A, B, C, DP, DQ, DR (2) X 2 = 6 class I, 8 class II
- Sequence Differences
- Concentrated in the regions involved in binding peptide and TCR
- Affect nature of peptides that can be bound by MHC molecules and interaction of MHC-peptide w/ TCR
- MHC Restriction
- T cells from one individual recognize peptide together w/ MHC molecules from same individual but not MHC from another
- Ability to recognize in context of self MHC is known as MHC restriction and is imprinted upon T cells during development
- MHC Diversity and Peptide-binding
- Different MHC molecules bind different sets of peptides
- For each molecule there is an identifiable peptide-binding motif
- Conserved residues w/in a motif are called anchor residues
- Polygenic nature of MHC and co-dominant expression of genes permits a larger set of peptides and the activation of more effective immune response
- Polymorphism is driven by intense selective pressure to be able to bind peptides from wide variety of pathogens

- Generation of new MHC alleles
- During meiosis, interallelic conversion (crossing-over)
- Resort different alleles into new haplotypes
- Gene conversion btwon different genes on same chromosome
- Combination of alleles is referred to as HLA type
- T cells from individual of one haplotype can recognize and respond to MHC molecules of another haplotype --&gt; allogenic differences
- Basis for transplantation rejection
- Some T cells may cross-react w/ complexes of donor MHC-donor peptide --&gt; mimics self MHC/foreign peptide complex
- May affect 1-10% of T cell clones
- Alloreactivity places constraint upon polygeny at the MHC locus

- HLA region
- Btwon DP and DQ, proteins for processing and presentation encoded (TAP, tapasin, proteasome)
- Interferons up-regulate expression of these genes and MHC genes
- Constitutive and induced expression of MHC class II is coordinated by CIITA
- Deficiency causes BLS of class II/CD4 T cells
- Class III region
- Located btwon class II and I
- Encodes other immune related genes, incl. complement proteins, TNF, LTB, LTA
