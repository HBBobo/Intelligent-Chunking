IPD-SHEL Source Undetermined

The gastric mucosa contains a number of cell types which contribute to its function. Mucus epithelial cells and overlying mucus contribute to the gastric mucosal barrier. Parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid (and in the human, intrinsic factor) while chief cells produce and secrete the protease precursor pepsinogen. ECL cells do not contact the gland lumen synthesize and release the paracrine regulator histamine. Mucus neck cells include the stem cells which divide, differentiate and move up and down the gland in normal cellular turnover.

At low secretory rates most gastric secretion is by surface cells and is NaCl rich. A small amount of HCl is secreted by parietal cells but even at 10 mM results in a pH of 2.0. When secretion is stimulated the output of parietal cells increases 10 fold so H⁺ increases to over 100 mM; the K⁺ concentration also increases. Loss of gastric acid due to excessive vomiting can result in acid base abnormalities (alkalosis, hypokalemia).

# Mechanism of HCl Secretion by the Parietal Cell (Diagram p.43)

IPD-SWEL John Williams

Hydrochloric acid secretion by the parietal cell essentially involves separation of  $\mathrm{H^{+}}$  ions which are released into the gastric lumen and  $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$  released into the blood.  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  diffuses into the cell from plasma or is produced by cellular metabolism. It becomes hydrated to  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{CO}_3$  (carbonic acid), a process facilitated by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{CO}_3$  dissociates into  $\mathrm{H^{+}}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{CO}_3^-$ . At the apical membrane  $\mathrm{H^{+}}$  is transported out of the cell in exchange for  $\mathrm{K^{+}}$  by the  $\mathrm{H^{+} - K^{+}}$  ATPase which is also known as the "Proton pump." The  $\mathrm{K^{+}}$  taken into the cell recycles back out into the gastric lumen via a  $\mathrm{K^{+}}$  channel resulting in the elevated  $\mathrm{K^{+}}$  concentration of gastric juice. The final component of gastric HCl is  $\mathrm{Cl^-}$  which exits passively through a  $\mathrm{Cl^-}$  channel. Thus, the apical  $\mathrm{H^{+} - K^{+}}$  ATPase drives the secretion of HCl. At the basolateral membrane of the parietal cell a  $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$  exchanger promotes  $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$  exit and  $\mathrm{Cl^-}$  uptake thus maintaining homeostasis of intracellular  $\mathrm{H^{+}}$  (pH) and Cl. The basolateral membrane also contains a  $\mathrm{Na^{+} - K^{+}}$  ATPase which maintains intracellular  $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$  and  $\mathrm{K^{+}}$  as in other cells.

The H-K ATPase is related structurally and functionally to the ubiquitous  $\mathrm{Na^{+} - K^{+}}$  ATPase and the  $\mathrm{Ca^{2 + }}$  ATPase present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle. It contains a catalytic  $\alpha$  subunit and a glycoprotein  $\beta$  subunit which is required for targeting. The H-K ATPase is the target for proton pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) such as Omeprazole. PPIs are weak bases and concentrate in the low pH of the gastric gland where they are activated by molecular rearrangement in response to the low pH. The active drug then binds covalently to cysteine residues in the H-K ATPase, the predominant protein in the apical membrane of activated parietal cells, thereby inhibiting its function in a irreversible manner. PPIs are more potent inhibitors of acid secretion then  $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  blockers and are used to treat acid reflux disease, gastric acid hypersecretion, and as part of therapy to eradicate H. Pylori in the treatment of ulcers. Current PPIs include Prilosec (OTC), Nexium and Protonix.

The H⁺, K⁺ ATPase is the molecular target of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole. The molecules are activated in the acid environment of the gastric gland and covalently bind to cysteine residues in the α subunit of the ATPase.

# Morphological Transformation of Parietal Cells Upon Stimulation

PD-INEL Source Undetermined

At rest, most of the H⁺-K⁺ ATPase is present within the cell in tubules and vesicles in an inactive form. Upon parietal cell stimulation these vesicles fuse with the luminal membrane which becomes greatly increased in surface area and now includes the H⁺-K⁺ ATPase in a location where it can transport H⁺ into the lumen. This transformation requires an intact cytoskeleton and is reversed upon removal of the secretory stimulus.

Gastric acid secretion is stimulated by Histamine acting on a $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor, Gastrin acting on a Gastrin receptor and Acetylcholine which acts on a M3 muscarinic receptor. All three receptors are 7 transmembrane domain, G protein coupled receptors. Specific antagonists exist for all three receptors and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ antagonists (prototype: Cimetidine) are used clinically to reduce acid secretion. Xantac (Ranitidine) is now sold over the counter. Histamine and Gastrin or Acetylcholine show potentiation of response, i.e., the response to the combination is bigger than the sum of the individual responses. It is this phenomenon that underlies the efficacy of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blockers to inhibit secretion. Somatostatin (not shown) acts on a specific receptor which is coupled to an inhibitory G protein and inhibits adenylate cyclase and thereby the effect of histamine.

# INTEGRATED CONTROL OF GASTRIC ACID SECRETION BY NEURAL AND HUMORAL PATHWAYS

1. Vagus acts directly on parietal cells and indirectly by effects on gastrin and histamine release.
2. Histamine released from enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells) reaches parietal cells by local diffusion.
3. Gastrin released from antral G cells reaches parietal cells by systemic circulation.
4. Inhibitory regulators include somatostatin released from D cells in the antrum and body of stomach, prostaglandins from surface cells, and intestinal hormones collectively termed "enterogastrone."

Gastrin release from G cells of the antrum is stimulated by luminal acids and digested proteins, and is inhibited in a paracrine fashion by somatostatin released in response to luminal acid. Somatostatin is released when gastric pH &lt;3.0.

# METHODS FOR MEASURING ACID SECRETION

1. Gastric Aspiration
2. Intragastric Titration
3. Basal vs. Peak Acid Output

# PEPSIN

1. Proteolytic enzyme secreted by chief cells as an inactive precursor, pepsinogen.
2. Release stimulated by vagal nerve and by presence of acid in stomach.
3. Activated by peptide cleavage at acid pH.
4. Initiates digestion of protein

Pepsinogen is synthesized, stored in secretory granules, and released by exocytosis in response to increased intracellular $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ similar to pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion. After cleavage, pepsin is optimally active at pH 2 and is good proteolytic enzyme especially active on collagen. It is an endopeptidase acting on internal peptide bonds and its products are large peptides called peptones which are potent stimulators of gastrin and CCK release.

# INTRINSIC FACTOR

1. Glycoprotein of Mol. Wt. 55,000 which binds Vitamin B $_{12}$ (cobalamin).
2. Produced by parietal cells.
3. After binding $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ it binds receptors on ileal absorptive cells and is internalized by endocytosis.
4. Absent in pernicious anemia.

# THE MOLECULE OF INTRINSIC FACTOR AND ITS COBALAMIN COMPLEX

![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

Cobalamin in the diet is exclusively bound to animal protein. Adult requirement is about $2.5\ \mu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{day}$. Involved in methione synthesis (methyl transfer) and in fatty acid metabolism. Deficiency leads to anemia and nervous system damage. Release of cobalamine from food requires acid pH. Thus can get deficiency with chronic use of PPIs.

MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTING TO GASTRIC CYTOPROTECTION

# Gastric Mucosal Barrier

The gastric mucosa protects itself against acid and pepsin by a number of mechanisms that collectively are termed the “gastric mucosal barrier.” The barrier includes a prominent mucous layer and bicarbonate secreted by surface cells which sets up a pH gradient in the mucus. Other components of the barrier are the tight junctions between epithelial cells, surfactant like molecules secreted by mucosal cells and gastric mucosal blood flow which rapidly removes any penetrating acid. The mucosal cells can rapidly reconstitute any small break (within hours) by spreading into the space and reforming an intact layer. Substances that break the mucosal barrier include bile salts and lysolethicin (from biliary lethicin) if reflux across the pylorus occurs and exogenous substances such as ethanol and salicylates. Ethanol, being lipid soluble, is absorbed by the gastric mucosa and salicylates being weak acids are absorbed in the unionized form present in the lumen at low pH. Secretion of gastric mucous is stimulated by endogenous prostaglandins which explains the barrier breaking effect of nonsteroidal analgesics such as indomethacin.

# GASTRIC MOTILITY

1. Proximal – Receptive relaxation as stomach fills (Fundus)
2. Distal – Propulsive mixing and grinding (Antrum)
3. Pylorus – Regulates outflow

![img-21.jpeg](img-21.jpeg)
Entry of Food is Preceded by Gastric Relaxation
PD-INEL Source Undetermined

Pressures within the body of the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and the fundus region of the stomach. Resting pressure within the fundus is slightly above atmospheric pressure. With swallowing, the fundus relaxes before arrival of the bolus. After passage of the bolus into the stomach, fundic pressure returns to approximately the previous level. This relaxation after swallowing is mediated by vagal inhibitory fibers.

Antral Peristalis
PD-INEL Fig. 4-9 Granger, D, et al. Clinical Gastrointestinal Physiology. W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA; 1985: 84.

The distal stomach mixes gastric contents with secretions and helps break down food into small particles. Only particles smaller than 1 mm can exit through the pylorus. The major motor activity is peristalsis initiated by pacemaker cells in the midportion of the greater curvature of the stomach. These cells initiate a basal electrical rhythm of slow waves propagating toward the pylorus 3 times per minute. Muscular contraction is brought about by action potentials occurring when the smooth muscle cell PD depolarizes below threshold. Action potentials and gastric contraction are increased by vagal or gastrin stimulation and decreased by vagotomy or sympathetic stimulation.

# Relation of Contraction to Electrical Potential

![img-23.jpeg](img-23.jpeg)

In the top two panels the basal electrical rhythm or pacemaker potential is seen occurring 3 times/min but without muscle contraction. In the bottom two panels the pacemaker potential is generating action potentials and the resultant calcium influx induces contraction.

# Regulation of Gastric Emptying

Gastric emptying is regulated to prevent overload in intestine. Only particles less than 1 mm can pass through pylorus during digestive period.
