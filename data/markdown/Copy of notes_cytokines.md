# Cytokines and Chemokines

- Cytokines/chemokines are chemical messengers that allow cells to communicate with each other w/o cell-to-cell contact.
- Can act in endocrine, paracrine or autocrine manner
- Have multiple functions and multiple targets, ex. IL-1
- Induces fever
- Mobilizes lymphocytes from bone marrow
- Mobilizes insulin and glucagon
- Activates endothelial cells for increased adhesion to circulating leukocytes
- Activates lymphocytes to produce more IL-2
- Shared activities
- IL-1, IL-6, TNF
- Liver --&gt; acute phase proteins --&gt; complement opsonization
- Bone marrow endothelium --&gt; neutrophil mobilization --&gt; phagocytosis
- HT --&gt; increased body temperature
- Fat, muscle --&gt; protein and energy mobilization
- Activation of B and T lymphocytes
- When secreted in normal amounts cytokines are important in normal homeostasis like maintenance of circadian rhythm
- When secreted in larger amounts, important in cell recruitment, differentiation, inflammation
- In excess, can lead to pathology --&gt; cytokine storm

- Cytokine storm (septic shock)
- Bacterial toxins or LPS from gram-negative bacteria bind to TLRs on monocytes systematically
- Results in production of TNF, IL-1, other pro-inflammatory cytokines --&gt; fever
- n'phils are recruited to blood stream; lymphocytes/monocytes decrease
- Endothelial cells respond lowering BP and allowing n'phils to leave blood stream
- n'phils activate oxidative response and more vascular leakage --&gt; lowers BP even more
- Kinin proteolytic cascade is induced, results in production of bradykinin and increased vascular permeability
- Coagulation cascade is initiated --&gt; microclotting, DIC --&gt; liver, heart, kidney tissue don't get perfused
- Pro-inflammatory cytokines --&gt; other tissues --&gt; more inflammatory molecules
- Myocardial fxn reduced by TNF and IL-1 --&gt; more vascular leakage problems

- Cytokine signaling via Jak-Stat
- Binds to receptor
- Jak is phosphorylated
- Stat is phosphorylated and released
- Stat dimerizes
- Stat travels to nucleus and causes transcription

- Therapeutics
- TNF is pro-inflammatory cytokine prod by mono/lymphocytes
- Therapy w/ anti-TNF antibodies remarkably successful for improving symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's and psoriasis
- Made via hybridoma technology
- In order to prevent immune response to mouse constant region --&gt; humanize anti-TNF
- Recombinant technology to replace mouse constant region w/ human constant region
- Result is chimeric Ig genes
- Can even hybridize to the point that just the HV regions are from mouse

- Chemokines
- 40 small polypeptides secreted by many cells including lymphoid cells
- Act on n'phils to cause chemotaxis/activation
- Classified according to number and spacing of cysteines
- CC - adjacent, disulfide linked cysteines
- CXC - one separating the two
- "XC" or C w/ only one cysteine
- CX3C w/ three intervening
- Receptors usually named by chemokine they bind

- Type I interferons (α and β) produced by most cells
- Important in innate immunity against viruses
- Induce resistance to viral replication
- Increase MHC-I expression and antigen presentation in all cells
- Activates NK cells to kill virus-infected cells

- Viruses
- IL-10 anti-inflammatory by suppressing expression of other cytokines by T lymphocytes
- Also stimulates cell division and differentiation of B cells
- Epstein-barr encodes own version of IL-10 that increases B cell lifespan but blunts inflammatory responses against EBV
- Can also express soluble cytokine receptors that neutralize activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Can use receptors as co-receptors to enter cell
