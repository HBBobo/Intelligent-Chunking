Pharynx, Esophagus and Stomach

- General Features of the Tubular GI Tract
- 4 layers
- Mucosa
- Epithelium
- Lamina propria
- Muscularis mucosae
- Submucosa - dense irreg CT + submucosal plexus
- Muscularis externa
- Inner cicular layer
- Myenteric plexus
- Outer longitudinal band
- Serosa if peritoneal, adventitia if retroperitoneal - loose CT
- Major changes are in the mucosa
- Functions of the GI mucosa
- Protection - esophagus (food), stomach (acid), colon
- Absorption - small intestine, colon
- Secretion - stomach (small intestine)
- Secretion is accomplished by glands located in:
- Mucosa of stomach, small and large intestines
- Submucosa of esophagus, duodenum
- Outside of the tubular gut (extramural glands) - liver, pancreas
- Pharynx
- Lined by stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium
- Look for prominent elastic fibers in lamina propria - deep purple (fuchsin) or dark glassy red (H&amp;E)
- Skeletal muscle
- Mucous glands in muscular layer are extensions of those in the lamina propria
- No muscularis mucosae, submucosa
- Esophagus
- Straight, 25 cm long tube
- Expandable lumen due to extensive muscularis mucosae, elastic fibers in submucosa
- Stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium
- Upper 1/3 skeletal, middle 1/3 mixed, lower 1/3 smooth muscle
- Isolated lymphoid nodules and scattered leukocytes in lamina propria
- Thick layer of muscularis mucosae allows for expansion
- Mucous glands in upper and lower lamina propria; sero-mucous glands in middle submucosa
- Look for nerves (myenteric plexus) between layers of muscularis externa - large, dark nuclei and nucleolus
- Stomach
- General structure
- Same 4 layers
- Relatively thick mucosa w/ numerous tubular glands
- Muscularis mucosa is thick and may have three layers of smooth muscle
- No glands in submucosa
- Empty stomach, mucosa into longitudinal folds (rugae)
- Surfaced is further subdivided by gastric pits continuous w/ tubular glands
- Middle circularis layer of externa is thickened to form pyloric sphincter
- Cardiac glands
- Mucous glands w/ pale staining cytoplasm and basal nuclei

Histology Page 4

- Cardio-esophageal junction - abrupt transition from mucosa with stratified squamous epithelium to glandular mucosa of stomach
- Cardiac glands are columnar cells with "bubbly" supranuclear cytoplasm

- Gastric Glands
- Fundus and corpus regions
- Pits are shallow and tubular glands relatively longer
- Tall columnar cells lining luminal surface and pits have basally located nuclei and lightly staining cytoplasm; secrete mucus
- Parietal cells are large and ovoid to pyramidal in shape, base adjacent to basement membrane; eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm; secrete H+ and intrinsic factor
- Chief cells in lower one-third to one-half of glands; basophilic cytoplasm on base; secrete pepsinogen
- Lymphoid nodules
- Strands of smooth muscle fibers from inner layer of muscularis mucosae extend between glands toward the surface may help in emptying glands

- Pyloric Glands
- Pyloric sphincter creates thick wall (inner circular layer of externa)
- Pyloric glands at base of pits are mainly mucous cells, pits are deeper than cardiac
