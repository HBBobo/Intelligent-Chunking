# GRADING OF ANGINA PECTORIS BY THE CANADIAN CARDIOVASCULAR SOCIETY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

## Class I:
Ordinary physical activity does not cause angina, such as walking, climbing stairs.

## Class II:
Slight limitation of ordinary activity. Angina occurs on walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking uphill, walking or climbing stairs after a meal, or in cold, or in wind, or under emotional stress, or only during the few hours after awakening. Angina occurs on walking more than two blocks on the level and climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a normal pace and in normal conditions.

Reference: JACC 1999; 33: 2092-197

# GRADING OF ANGINA PECTORIS BY THE CANADIAN CARDIOVASCULAR SOCIETY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

## Class III:
Marked limitations of ordinary physical activity. Angina occurs on walking one to two blocks on the level and climbing one flight of stairs in normal conditions and at a normal pace.

## Class IV:
Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort—anginal symptoms may be present at rest.

# PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

## DETERMINATES OF MYOCARDIAL OXYGEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND

### CORONARY BLOOD FLOW
- Vascular tone
- Coronary perfusion pressure
- Collaterals
- Duration of diastole

### MYOCARDIAL O₂ CONSUMPTION
- Wall tension
- Contractility
- Heart rate
- Preload
- Afterload

# COLLATERAL FLOW

![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)

PD-THEL

# COLLATERAL FLOW

![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)

PD-2001

# VASCULAR TONE

- External arterial compression during systole
- Intrinsic autoregulation
- Metabolic factors
- Reduced oxygen → vasodilation
- Reduced ATP → adenosine → vasodilation
- Endothelial factors
- EDRF - NO → vasodilation
- Prostacyclin → vasodilation
- Endothelin-1 → vasoconstriction
- Neural factors
- α - adrenergic receptors → vasoconstriction
- β - adrenergic receptors → vasodilation

# CORONARY PERFUSION PRESSURE

- Approximated by diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
- Marked reductions in DBP lead to hypoperfusion... eg. hypotension, severe aortic valve regurgitation

# DIASTOLE

- Flow to coronaries in systole reduced by:
- external compression of arteries
- local venturi effect in ascending aorta
- Heart rate ↑ compromises diastolic filling time

# HEART RATE

- ↑ # of contractions requires more ATP generation... this requires more oxygen

# CONTRACTILITY

- ↑ Force of contraction requires more ATP... increases O₂ consumption

# PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CHRONIC ISCHEMIC SYNDROMES

- Fixed vessel narrowing
- Endothelial cell dysfunction
- Non-Coronary factors

# FIXED VESSEL STENOSIS

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

# ENDOTHELIAL CELL DYSFUNCTION

- Normal response to stress: vasodilation...increased blood flow/shear stress→ sympathetic activation→ EDRF - NO
- Normal vessel: EDRF - NO outweighs α - constriction from catecholamines
- Diseased vessel: vasoconstrictive response overcomes inadequate EDRF - NO release..."sensitized" to vasoconstrictive platelet products

# NON-CORONARY FACTORS

## Inadequate Oxygen Supply
- Anemia
- Hypoxia
- Decreased perfusion pressure...hypotension, aortic regurgitation

## Increased Oxygen Demand
- Aortic stenosis
- Severe HCM
- Thyrotoxicosis

# DIAGNOSIS

- History
- Physical exam
- Electrocardiogram
- Exercise ECG test
- Exercise test with imaging
- Pharmacological stress test
- Coronary angiography

HISTORY: “ANGINA”

Quality
- Tightness
- Constriction
- Not pleuritic
- Radiation - jaws, arms
- Heaviness
- Not “stabbing”
- Dull, not sharp
- Association: SOB, sweat

Duration
- Steady, lasts minutes
- More than a few seconds
- Not usually ≥ 10-15 min.

Provocation
- Exertion, emotion
- Cold air
- Large meal

Relief
- Nitroglycerine - sec. to min.
- Rest

# PHYSICAL EXAM

## During ischemia

- ↑ BP
- ↑ HR
- Diaphoresis

- Transient mitral valve regurgitation (rare)
- Pulmonary rales (rare)

## Not during ischemia

- Usually no abnormal findings
- Occasional associated issues:
- aortic stenosis
- HCM
- systolic murmur
- aortic regurgitation - diastolic murmur

# ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

- Usually shows change during an episode
- Typically transient ST-segment depression or T-wave flattening/inversion
- Rarely transient ST-segment elevation

|  Normal | Subendocardial ischemia |   |   | Transmural ischemia  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | ST depression (horizontal) | ST depression (downsloping) | T wave inversion | ST elevation  |

PD-INEL

# EXERCISE ECG STRESS TEST

Treadmill or bicycle exercise
Constant monitoring of:
- 12 lead ECG
- heart rate
- BP (periodically)
Graded increase in exercise until:
- angina occurs with ECG changes... or
- marked ischemia on ECG... or
- target heart rate is reached... or
- patient can no longer continue

# STRESS TEST SIGNS: "SEVERE" CAD

- SX/ECG change occurs in 1st 3-6 min. of exercise or persists &gt; 5 min. after
- Magnitude of ST depression ≥ 2mm
- Systolic BP falls during exercise
- High grade arrythmia - eg. Sustained ventricular tachycardia - occurs
- Cardiopulmonary limitations preclude exercise beyond 2-3 min.

# EXERCISE TEST WITH IMAGING

## Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy

- Nuclear tracer injected at peak exercise → image the heart
- Myocardium perfused by narrowed artery “takes” up less tracer than that served by normal coronaries
- Compare relative myocardial uptake at rest to that with exercise...
- Exercise “cold” spots that look normal at rest... viable heart muscle served by stenotic arteries
- Exercise cold spots that are also present at rest: dead heart muscle or very severe ↓ flow

# EXERCISE TEST WITH IMAGING

## Echocardiographic wall motion

- Image LV wall motion at rest
- Image immediately $\overline{p}$ maximum stress
- Ischemic myocardium shows:
- reduced systolic wall thickening
- reduced systolic wall motion... hypokinesia/akinesia

# PHARMACOLOGIC STRESS TEST: CHOICES

## Adenosine - Thallium or Sestamibi:
- Vasodilator
- Myocardial perfusion image
- Narrowed vessels have ↓ vasodilatory response c/w normal
- Before/after images → “relative” ↓ tracer uptake

## Dobutamine Echocardiography
- Catecholemine stress mimics exercise
- Image for ischemia by ECG and wall motion analysis

# CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY

- Direct injection of radiopaque dye into coronary arteries
- Carries higher risk c/w noninvasive testing
- Most reliable method to obtain anatomical data
- When to do:
- to establish Dx when uncertainty exists
- to identify advanced CAD for potential revascularization $\overline{c}$ PCI or CABG

# PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION

- Catheter based opening of fixed artery obstruction - main use is angina not / controlled with medical Rx.
- Multiple types of devices
- Balloon
- Laser
- Stent
- Cutting catheter
- Rotoblator
- Drug Eluting Stent
- Relieves angina caused by stenoses of &gt; 50-60%... esp. when more severe
- Does not prevent acute MI in stable angina... issue is restenosis in 15-40% of pts.

# Chronic CAD

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The balloon is deflated and the catheter is removed from the body, leaving the stent permanently in place.

# CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY

- Surgically bypass arteries with advanced fixed obstruction
- Involves up front risk of death, stroke, sternal infection, post-op debility
- Relieves angina reliably
- Prolongs life in select anatomic subsets
- Disease can return in bypass grafts... arterial grafts preferred... left internal mammary artery to LAD

# Chronic CAD

## Relative Advantages of Coronary Revascularization Procedures

### Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI)
- Less invasive than CABG
- Shorter hospital stay and easier recuperation than CABG
- Superior to pharmacological therapy for relief of angina

### Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (CABG)
- More effective for long-term relief of angina than PCI or pharmacologic therapy
- Most complete survival in patients with:
- &gt; 50% left main stenosis
- 3-vessel CAD, especially if LV contractile function is impaired
- 2-vessel disease with tight (&gt;75%) LAD stenosis, especially if LV contractile function is impaired
- Diabetes and multivessel disease

CAD, coronary artery disease; LV, left ventricle; LAD, left anterior descending coronary artery; MI, myocardial infarction.

# CHRONIC STABLE ANGINA: THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS

- Improves symptoms:
- β-blocker
- Ca++ blockers
- PCI
- Nitrates
- Statins
- CABG

- Prevents acute ischemic syndromes:
- ASA
- Lipid lowering agents

- ? ACE inhibitors

- Prolongs life
- CABG in: → [Left main stenosis signif. 3 vessel disease 2 vessel with prox. LAD] → [Especially if ↓ LV function and/or (+) stress test]
