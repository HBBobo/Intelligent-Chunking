# T Cell Development

Friday, February 15, 2008

11:00 AM

- T cell development in Thymus
- Common precursor for αβ and γδ T cells
- Bone marrow derived
- Migrates to thymus
- Once mature, T cells leave thymus to reside in secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen, lymph nodes and GALT
- Thymus
- Thymocytes = developing T cells
- Thymic stroma epithelial cells
- Cortex is densely packed
- Macrophages
- Site of beginning of T cell maturation --&gt; move to medulla as they mature
- Medulla is loosely packed
- Dendritic cells concentrated at jxn
- Macrophages
- DiGeorge's is lack of thymus --&gt; severe immunodeficiency
- Most active in early life; disappears by 30
- Thymectomy does not result in immunodeficiency

- Early T Cell Development
- Early T cells do not express CD4 or CD8 co-receptors (double-negatives)
- Mature through CD44+CD25- --&gt; CD44+CD25+ --&gt; CD44lowCD25+
- CD25 is a chain of the IL-2R
- CD44lowCD25+ rearrangement of β, γ, δ genes initiated
- αβ vs. γδ first commitment
- If γδ rearranges first successfully --&gt; committed to γδ lineage
- More commonly, β rearrangement first and expression of TCRβ at cell surface complex w/ pre-T cell receptor α chain (invariant, non-singaling)
- Rearrangement at TCRβ locus has second chance due to second locus
- Signaling from pTα
- Prevents further rearrangement of TCR genes
- Proliferative burst initiated --&gt; CD4 and CD8 both expressed (double positive)
- Following burst, TCR rearrangement at TCRα, γ, δ loci
- αβ vs. γδ second commitment
- If γδ rearranges successfully --&gt; committed to γδ lineage
- More commonly, α rearrangement first and expression of αβ TCR and diverted away from γδ lineage
- Rearrangement of α
- Productive rearrangement does not necessarily lead to cessation of additional rearrangement on the same or homologous chromosome
- γδ T cells
- TCRγδ also generated in separate pathway very early in embryonic development
- Early cells populate repro/GI tracts and skin
- Later in development, αβ predominate and all the T cells produced populate all peripheral lymphoid organs
- γδ do not recognize MHC/peptide complexes; fxn unknown
- Successful rearrangement is complete development

- Positive Selection
- Enough different TCRαβ receptors are produced during T cell development to allow recognition of

each of the different MHC molecules that occur in the population in combination w/ peptide

- Only those T cells that have TCRs w/ specificity for self MHC plus peptide are allowed to mature further
- Mediated by epithelial cells in cortex which present class I and II w/ peptide
- Majority of T cells not selected and undergo apoptosis
- Double positive thymocytes mature into either CD4 or CD8 depending on TCR MHC specificity
- Stochastic - random loss then binding to CD4/8, if binds T cell survives
- Instructional - CD4/8 engages to MHC and directs loss of CD8/4 (more accepted theory)
- Recombination at TCRα is turned off when T cell expresses a TCR that can be positively selected
- Mechanism allows the developing T cell multiple attempts at generating TCR that recognize self MHC

- Negative selection
- Many developing cells express TCR w/ affinity for self MHC+self peptide
- If allowed to mature and enter circulation, they will cause autoimmune diseases
- Mediated by dendritic cells/macrophages in medulla of thymus
- Different signals must be given or signals must be received differently than positive selection - we don't know what the differences are
- Tregs - TCR-expressing T cells that arise in thymus in response to self peptide +MHC
- Major role as negative regulators of autoimmune T cell responses in peripheral immune system

- Development of Mature T Cells
- Single positive T cells that have gone through all of the processes above leave thymus and go to secondary lymphoid organs
- Mature T cells flow btwn those organs and circulation until they encounter foreign antigens
- Antigenic challenge of CD4/8 --&gt; T cell differentiation to aid in removal of antigen from host

- BLS and Thymic Selection
- TAP deficiency --&gt; class I deficiency; CIITA deficiency --&gt; class II deficiency
- Can treat by irradiating and chemo then transplant bone marrow
- b/c in thymus, thymocytes are donor derived but selected on recipient HLA allotype
- Circulating T cells restricted by recipient allotypes
- APCs present antigens on donor HLA allotypes
- No response
- Therefore, successful transplantation requires at least one common class I and class II allele

- T Cell leukemias and thymic selection
- Intermediate T cells are highly subject to cell death and therefore rarely become leukemias
- Most T cell leukemias develop from early T cell progenitors or mature T cells
