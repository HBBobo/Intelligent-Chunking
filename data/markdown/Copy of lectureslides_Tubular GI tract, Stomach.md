# Functions of the Gl mucosa*

(*Mucosa = Epithelium, lamina propria, muscularis mucosae)

Protection - Esophagus, stomach, colon
Absorption - Small intestine (colon)
Secretion - Stomach (Small intestine)

Secretion is accomplished by glands located:

a. In the mucosa (stomach, small + large intestine)
b. In the submucosa (only in esophagus, duodenum)
c. Outside of the tubular gut (extramural glands) e.g., liver, pancreas.

# Pharynx

Short region connecting oral cavity with the larynx and esophagus.

Passageway for air and food; Resonating chamber for speech

# Pharynx

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

Epithelium: stratified squamous non-keratinized

Prominent elastic fibers in lamina propria

Muscle wall: striated muscle

No muscularis mucosae, no submucosa.

(accessory salivary gland)

# Esophagus

Delivers food and liquid from pharynx to stomach

## Attributes:

Straight tube, ~25 cm long

Expandable lumen: extensive muscularis mucosae, elastic fibers in submucosa

Protective epithelium (stratified squamous non-keratinized)

## Muscularis externa:

- upper 1/3 = striated (skeletal) muscle
- middle 1/3 = mixed smooth and striated
- lower 1/3 = smooth muscle

# Esophagus

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

© 2000 Young &amp; Heath, Wheater's Functional Histology, 4th ed. (2000), p253 Fig 14.4a

## Epithelium (E): Stratified squamous Non-keratinized

## Extensive muscularis mucosae (MM)

## Glands (G)

- Mostly in submucosa
- Primarily mucous secretion
- Note: upper and lower esophagus also has MUCOSAL glands (called "cardiac" due to similarity to cardiac glands of the stomach)

## Muscularis externa (Muscularis propria): Inner circular (CM) Outer longitudinal (LM)

As with any region of the GI tract, lymph nodules (Ly) may be present – usually in the lamina propria and occasionally extending into the submucosa

# Esophagus

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas,  $5^{th}$  ed. (2006), p522 Fig 17.2

# Lymphatic nodules in lamina propria and/or submucosa (part of GALT, gut-associated lymphoid tissue)

Esophageal glands (submucosal) secrete acidic mucous - lubricates the luminal wall; ducts carry secreted mucous to the lumen.

# Esophagus: mucosa &amp; submucosa

# Controls contraction of muscularis externa; wave-like contractions that move contents = peristalsis

# Gastroesophageal junction

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

## Abrupt epithelial transition:

### Stratified squamous non-keratinized (esophagus)

![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)

### simple columnar (stomach)

"Cardiac glands" of the esophagus (mucosal, i.e. IN LAMINA PROPRIA); secrete neutral mucous, protect esophagus from stomach acid

Cardiac glands of the stomach; also mucosal (in the lamina propria) and also mucus-secreting

PD-THEL

Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed. (2006). Fig. 17.6, p.525

Esophagus

Stomach

![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

- 200-300EL University of Michigan Virtual Microscopy slide collection, slide #155

Inferior esophageal sphincter = a physiological sphincter

- Pressure difference between esophagus and stomach
- Diaphragmatic contraction
- Unidirectional peristalsis

Prevents reflux of stomach contents into esophagus

# Gastroesophageal junction

A medically important region:

Pyrosis (heartburn) – acid reflux

Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing)
- Generic term used to describe ANY difficulty in swallowing
- Could be something “extrinsic:” mediastinal mass, vascular anomaly
- Could be “intrinsic:” e.g. esophageal tumor, inflammation, motility disorder

Achalasia (“failure to relax”)
- Lack of peristalsis in the lower esophagus due to loss of myenteric neurons (chalasis = relaxation)

Barrett’s esophagus/Intestinal metaplasia
- Change in esophageal mucosa from squamous to “intestinal” (i.e. columnar)
- Result of prolonged injury: e.g. chronic reflux, noxious agents (smoking, etc.)
- “pre-cancerous:” 10% risk of progression to adenocarcinoma

Esophageal cancer
- Squamous cell carcinoma – carcinogenesis of basal cells
- Adenocarcinoma – progression of Barrett’s esophagus into cancer or (rarely) from submucosal glands

# Stomach

Mixes and partially digests food → Chyme

## Attributes:

- Expanded region where food can reside while initial digestion occurs
- Mechanism to digest food: acid, enzymes
- Mechanisms to prevent self-digestion
- Mechanism to prevent undigested food from passing on to the small intestine

# Stomach

![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)

Four anatomical regions:
a. Cardia - Cardiac glands
b. Fundus* - Gastric glands
c. Corpus* - Gastric glands
d. Pylorus - Pyloric glands

# Rugae - longitudinal folds (allow distention)

duodenum

Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed. (2006). Fig. 17.5, p.524

Because they are HISTOLOGICALLY similar, histologists lump fundus and corpus together (and you may sometimes hear gastric glands referred as “fundic glands” –the terms are synonymous)

# Stomach

Rugae: folds of mucosa w/ submucosal core – somewhat analogous to intestinal plicae* - allow stomach to distend

Pits (foveolae): invaginations of mucosal epithelium (similar to intestinal crypts*); continuous with the lumen of underlying glands

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

* More about plicae and intestinal crypts in a later lecture

PS-INEL

University of Michigan Virtual Microscopy slide collection, slide #156

# Cardiac glands - stomach

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

esophageal epithelium

In cardiac region - located at gastro-esophageal junction

Epithelium consists of simple columnar, mostly mucous cells (pale, homogeneous staining – similar to cells lining the pits)

Tubular, somewhat tortuous, and sometimes branched

Empty into gastric pits

PS-1REL

Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed. (2006). Fig. 17.14, p.532

# Fundic (Gastric) glands - stomach

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Shallow pits open to long branched glands

Pits are lined by mucous cells (Pit cells)

Glands contain:
- Stem cells
- Mucous neck cells
- Parietal cells
- Chief cells

Each cell type takes up stain differently so these glands will have a heterogeneous appearance

Produce gastric juice (~ 2L/day)

# Anatomy of a gastric gland

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

Pit lined by surface mucous cells

Short isthmus region - contains stem cells (can't identify without immunostaining, but know their approximate location and function)

Several glands (2-3) open into one pit

Neck lined by mucous neck cells, with some parietal cells

Parietal, chief and enteroendocrine cells occupy glandular portion

Original: Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed. (2006). Fig. 17.8b, p.527

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

# Gastric gland - PAS* stain

Mucus of the mucous surface cells - Viscous, insoluble mucus with bicarbonate (deep purple)

Mucous of the mucous neck cells - More soluble, watery mucous

Physiologic gastric mucosa barrier

*PAS = periodic acid Schiff (stains mucous)

PG-1REL

Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed. (2006). Fig. 17.8a, p.527

# Parietal cells

## Major secretions:
- Intrinsic factor (binds Vitamin B12; required for absorption of B12 in ileum)
- HCl (ATPase exchange pumps and ion transport channels move H+ and Cl- into lumen)

## REQUIRES:
- Lots of mitochondria
- Lots of surface area

Drawing of a parietal cell with ion flow illustrated over membrane surfaces removed

## Eosinophilic due to:
- Abundant membranes (microvilli, canaliculi, tubulovesicular system
- Numerous mitochondria

# Enteroendocrine cells

- Found throughout GI tract
- Not very easy to see by LM in the stomach, but can identify them in EMs

"Open" type:
- Secretory granules in basolateral domain
- Microvilli project into lumen

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

# Enteroendocrine cells

Drawing of a "closed type" entero-endocrine cell.

Original: Fig 17.12 from Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed. (2006), p530

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

"Closed" type: Cell rests on basal lamina; does not reach lumen

# Enteroendocrine cells
"Diffuse neuroendocrine system" (DNES)

- Classified by staining for products
- ~20 different types
- ALL secrete primarily into connective tissue space NOT the lumen of the GI tract

## Important examples in stomach:

- Gastrin - stimulates parietal cells to secrete HCl
- Somatostatin - Inhibits gastrin release, inhibits HCl secretion
- Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) - stimulates pancreatic and intestinal enzyme secretion; inhibits sphincter contraction

a.k.a:
APUD (Amine Precursor Uptake and Decarboxylation) cells*, Enterochromaffin cells*, argentaffin cells*, argyrophil cells*

* These terms actually refer to specific sub-types of cells, whereas the term “enteroendocrine” covers ALL types

# Pylorus - stomach

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

Deep pits open to Relatively straight glands

Mostly mucous cells (occasional parietal cells)

PR-THEL

Ross and Pawlina, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 5th ed. (2006), p533 Fig 17.15

# Comparison of stomach glands

## Pit depth (% of mucosa)
- Cardiac - 50%
- Gastric - 25%
- Pyloric - 66%

## Gland morphology
- Cardiac – tortuous, homogeneous
- Gastric – straight, heterogeneous
- Pyloric – ~tortuous, homogeneous

## Location
- Cardiac – near gastro-esophageal junction.
- Gastric – in fundus and corpus
- Pyloric – near gastro-duodenal junction.

Original: Fig 15-10 from Junqueira and Carneiro, Basic Histology, 10th ed. (2003), p300

# Gastroduodenal junction:

- Transition from gastric epithelium (with pits) to intestinal epithelium (with crypts &amp; villi)
- Duodenal region specifically identifiable by presence of SUBMUCOSAL glands
- Pyloric sphincter, a true anatomical sphincter, expansion of circular layer of smooth muscle
