# Sequence Contents: Pharmacology

Since most drug therapy is oral, the gastrointestinal tract plays a crucial role in drug absorption metabolism and pharmacokinetics.

## Pharmacology (Osawa): Introduces the basic principles that govern absorption and metabolism of drugs.

Drug Disposition
Drug Metabolism I, II and III

# Textbooks

In addition to those recommended earlier,

1. Gastrointestinal Physiology by Kim E. Barrett published by Lange (McGraw Hill) 2006
2. Gastrointestinal Physiology, 7th edition, by Leonard R. Johnson published by Mosby, An Affiliate of Elsevier, 2007.

Both should be viewed as supplementary and the lectures will not follow them directly but they cover the material. They are both paperbacks.
