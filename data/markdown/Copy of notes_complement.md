# Complement Self-Study Module

- Complement Cascade
- Proteins produced in liver to direct pathogen destruction; covalently bound and more permanent
- Once one complement protein binds, multiple proteins bind all directing towards cell injury

- Complement Pathways
- Classical - begins w/ antigen-antibody binding --&gt; adaptive immune response
- Lectin - begins w/ non-specific protein binding to antigen --&gt; innate
- Alternative - begins w/ complement binding --&gt; innate
- All lead to covalent binding of C3b to pathogen
- 3 possible outcomes: opsonization, inflammation, lysis

- Activation of complements
- Most proteins have naming as C#(a/b)
- Each C protein is cleaved into a/b fragments by convertases
- "a" fragment may have something to do w/ inflammation
- "b" fragment is usually covalently bound

- Classical Pathway
- Antibody binds to antigen
- C1q binds to antibody (r, s have enzymatic activity)
- C1q only binds to IgM (pentameric, so only one needed) or IgG (multiple needed)
- C1q --&gt; C1r --&gt; C1s --&gt; cleavage of C4 to reveal thioester bond on C4b for nucleophilic attack
- C4b then binds to pathogen; C1s then cleaves C2 into C2a and C2b
- C2b non-covalently associates w/C4b to make C3 convertase of the classical pathway (C4b,2b)
- Convertase up to 1000 C3 --&gt; C3a + C3b
- C3b binds to pathogen surface

- Lectin Pathway
- Mannose binding protein binds to mannose, structurally similar to C1
- Non-specific
- Mannose found on many pathogens
- Virtually identical to classical pathway for the next steps

- Alternative Pathway
- Auto activation of C3--&gt;spontaneous C3 cleavage
- C3b binds to cell surface
- Factor B associates to C3b and is cleaved by complement D to Ba and Bb
- C3b,Bb stabilized by properdin
- C3b,Bb,properdin = C4b,2b
- Multiple C3b's bind to cell surface = amplification
- Same is possible for classical and lectin pathways

- Opsonization
- Macrophages have CR1 which recognizes C3b and C4b (negligible)
- This makes it easier for phagocytosis to take place

- Inflammation
- Small fragments released (a fragments)
- C3a, C5a, C4a (lesser extent) mediate inflammation --&gt; anaphylatoxins
- Stimulate degranulation of mast cells --&gt; release histamine --&gt; similar to anaphylactic rxn
- Anaphylatoxins + Mast cell mediators --&gt; aid macrophage adhesion/migration to cell wall
- C5a works as chemoattractant for neutrophils/monocytes

- MAC complex
- Complex of proteins to form pore in cell --&gt; open flow of water and ions to eventually cause lysis

of cell

- C3b + C3 convertase = C5 convertase
- C5b complexes w/ convertase --&gt; C6, C7, C8
- C7,C8 have hydrophobic regions to insert into membrane
- Up to 20 C9 molecules insert into membrane to form pore

- Immune Complexes can lead to classical pathway activation
- Circulating RBCs have CR1
- RBCs bind to immune complexes and carry the complexes out of circulation
- Classical pathway important in removal of circulating immune complexes

- Other Outcomes
- Breakdown products --&gt; B cell activation via CR2

- Complement Deficiencies
- Deficiencies in C1, C4, C2 --&gt; inability to remove immune complexes from circulation
- Injury by depositing in basement membrane of body tissues
- Arthritis, renal problems, rash; similar to lupus
- C2 deficiency is most common (1/10,000)
- Alternative pathway deficiencies
- Problems w/ opsonization, phagocytosis
- Increased risk of pyogenic bacterial infection
- Deficiencies in C5-9
- Inability to from membrane attacking complex
- Important in neisserial defense
- Increased risk of neisserial infection
- Deficiencies in MBP
- Recurrent pyogenic infection
- Failure to thrive

- Regulation
- Nothing to stop complements from binding to host cells
- Host cells must have something to prevent
- DAF - GPI anchored protein
- Prevents binding of C3b and Bb to make C5 convertases
- Can also cause dissociation of C5 convertases
- Inhibits all 3 pathways
- Defects in GPI anchor --&gt; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria prob due to increased susceptibility to complement attack
- C1-INH
- C1 inhibitor
- Deficiency: hereditary angioneurotic edema
- Too much C4a, C2a
- Causes edema --&gt; laryngeal particularly problematic b/c of suffocation
- Treated w/ infusion of C1-INH
- Protectin (CD-59)
- GPI anchored
- Inhibits formation of MAC
- Membrane Cofactor Protein: Acts as cofactor for proteolytic cleavage of C3b by factor I
- CR1
- Membrane bound receptor
- Protects host cells by inhibiting association of convertases
- Can act as cofactor for factor I
- Factor I: Plasma protein that cleaves C4b, C3b
- Factor H: combines w/ C3b just like factor B but prevents factor B from binding
- Polyanionic environment of host cells due to sialic acid favors factor H binding
- Bacteria do not have same environment so factor B binds

- Serum Carboxypeptidase N (SCPN): Breaks down anaphylatoxins

- Clinical Testing
- Serum Complement Hemolytic Activity
- RBCs coated w/ antibodies
- Dilution of pt. serum added
- Classical pathway should be activated and RBCs should be lysed
- More active --&gt; should be able to dilute more
- Report 50% dilution: half of RBCs lysed
