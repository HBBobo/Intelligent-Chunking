## Stomach: (N 267)

- Cardia - area around opening of esophagus
- Body - part of stomach between fundus and pylorus, mucosal surface near lesser curvature has gastric folds
- Fundus - expanded superior part of stomach above entrance of esophagus, may contain gas bubbles in x-rays of patients filmed in a standing position
- Gastric rugae (N 268) - fold in mucosal lining of stomach
- Greater curvature - left/inferior/convex border of stomach
- Lesser curvature - right/superior/concave border of stomach
- Pyloric antrum - path from body to pylorus
- Pyloric sphincter (N 268,269) - muscular thickening from pylorus to duodenum
- Pylorus - constricted lower part of stomach
- Pyloroduodenal junction (N 268,269) - kind of self explanatory

## Abdominal esophagus (N 228,267)

- connects: superiorly with laryngopharynx at lower border of cricoid cartilage; inferiorly through diaphragm at T10 to reach the stomach; upper 1/3 skeletal muscle innervated by the recurrent laryngeal, lower 2/3rds smooth muscle innervated by the vagus nn. via the esophageal plexus

## Spleen (N 264,265,267,289)

- lymphatic organ suspended within greater omentum in upper left quadrant; connected to greater curvature of stomach by gastrosplenic ligament; connected to left kidney by splenorenal ligament; attached to left colic flexure; covered by visceral peritoneum on all surfaces

## Peritoneum

- Greater omentum (from dorsal mesogastrium) (N 261): apron like specialization of peritoneum attaching along grater curvature
- Gastrocolic lig. (N 261,264) - connects greater curvature with transverse colon
- Gastrosplenic lig. (N 264) - connects greater curvature with hilum of spleen
- Splenorenal lig. (N 264) - connects spleen to post ab wall over left kidney; contains tail of pancreas
- Omental apron (N 261) - part of greater omentum that hangs inferiorly from transverse colon
- Lesser omentum (from ventral mesogastrium) (N 267) - peritoneum stretching from lesser curvature to visceral surface of liver
- Hepatogastric lig. - connects liver to lesser curvature
- Hepatoduodenal lig. - connecter liver to 1st part of duodenum
- Omental (epiploic) foramen (N 264,267) - passageway between greater and lesser peritoneal sacs located posterior to hepatoduodenal ligament and first part of duodenum and anterior to the caudate lobe of the liver
- Omental bursa (lesser sac) (N 264,265,335,336) - part of peritoneal cavity located posterior to the stomach and lesser omentum, continuous with greater peritoneal sac at the omental foramen; aka lesser peritoneal sac

## Celiac trunk: (N 255)

- Left gastric a. (N 290) - from celiac artery; supplies part of stomach near lesser curvature; anastomoses w/ right gastric artery on lesser curvature and esophageal branches of thoracic aorta
- Gastric br.
- Esophageal br.
- Hepatic(?) br.
- Common hepatic a. (N 290) - from celiac a.; supplies liver, upper parts of duodenum, pancreas, right side of stomach and some foregut derivatives

Anatomy Page 4

Proper hepatic a. - supplies liver and lesser curvature of stomach

Right gastric a. - inferior part of stomach near lesser curvature; anastomoses w/ left gastric

Gastroduodenal a. - supplies upper duodenum, upper part of head of pancreas, greater curvature of stomach on the right

Posterior &amp; anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal aa. (N 290,292) - supplies the head of pancreas and upper part of duodenum

Right gastro-omental (-epiploic) a. - supplies lower part of pylorus, right part of greater curvature, greater omentum, anastomoses w/ left gastro-omental

Gastric brs. - branches to the stomach

Omental brs. - branches to the omentum

Splenic a. (N 291) - branches off celiac trunk to supply spleen, pancreas, greater curvature of stomach; passes deep to the stomach

Splenic brs. - branches from splenic a. to spleen

Short gastric aa. - supply fundus and upper part of stomach near greater curvature, passes through gastrosplenic lig.; 4-5 in number

Left gastro-omental (-epiploic) a. (N 290,291) - supplies mid-part of stomach near greater curvature and greater omentum; anastomoses w/ right gastro-omental

Gastric brs.

Omental brs.

Veins:

Portal v. (N 299,302) - formed by union of superior mesenteric and splenic v. along w/ posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal, right gastric, left gastric; drains into right and left branches before entering liver into liver sinusoids; drains all of gut and glands; connects w/ vena caval drainage at the esophagus, rectum, umbilicus, retroperitoneal gut structures; portal v. courses between two capillary beds (gut and liver)

Coronary v. - circle formed by left and right gastric v.

Left gastric v. - esophageal and gastric branches unite; drains into portal v.; drains lesser curvature of stomach and lower part of esophagus; communicates w/ esophageal vv. to form portal-caval anastomosis

Right gastric v. - drains lesser curvature of stomach

Nerves:

Anterior vagal trunk (N 236,309) - formed by fibers of esophageal plexus from left vagal nerve and running anterior to esophagus on lesser curvature; parasympathetic innervation of viscera

Gastric brs.

Hepatic brs. - travels in upper portion of hepatogastric ligament

Posterior vagal trunk (N 310) - formed by fibers of esophageal plexus from right vagal nerve and running posterior to esophagus on lesser curvature; parasympathetic innervation of viscera

Gastric brs.

Celiac brs. - deep to hepatogastric ligament

Celiac plexus (N 309,310,311) - preganglionic sympathetic axons arrive via greater thoracic splanchnic n. and synapse; postganglionic sympathetic nerves distribute via celiac plexus along branches of celiac a.; supplies vascular smooth muscle of brs. of celiac trunk and senses pain of viscera; ganglia located on abdominal aorta at origin of celiac trunk; branches of vagal n. pass through w/o synapsing

Miscellaneous:

Common bile duct (N 280,285,290,292) - in hepatoduodenal ligament; transmits bile from gall bladder to duodenum running behind stomach

Lymphatics (N 258,304,307) - all over the place

Clinical Terms:

Gastric &amp; duodenal ulcers - local defect of surface of an organ or tissue produced by sloughing off of inflammatory necrotic tissue; H. pylori plays important role; present w/ epigastric pain from food in stomach for gastric ulcers or lack of food for duodenal ulcers as well as satiety and

Anatomy Page 5

nausea

Vagotomy - cutting of vagus n.; bilaterally can lead to decreased motility of stomach and intestine, decreased gastric secretions, decreased tone of gallbladder and bile ducts, increased tone of sphincters

Gastrectomy - removal of all or part of stomach in some cases of intractable gastric ulcers or cancer

Splenectomy - removal of spleen; sometimes done in leukemia or lymphoma; capsule may rupture in trauma

Splenomegaly - enlargement of spleen

Pyloric stenosis - congenital thickening/narrowing of gastric outlet; more common in males; projectile non-bilious vomiting several weeks after birth; treated by pyloromyotomy where pylorus is cut all the way down to mucosa to relieve pressure
