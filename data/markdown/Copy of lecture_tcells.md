# Negative selection

1. Thymocytes die, if TCRs bind too strongly to MHC-peptide (self-peptides) complexes in the thymus.
2. The strength of signals received by TCRs is determined by peptides and the type of antigen presenting cells.

Differential signaling hypothesis

30

If T cells escape from selection processes in the thymus, what would be the consequences?

1. Failure of **positive** selection;
**Lack of functional T cells**

2. Failure of **negative** selection;
**Self-reactive T cells in the periphery resulting in autoimmunity**

31

The ultimate goal of selection is to produce T cells that are

- Self-MHC restricted to recognize foreign antigenic peptides with self-MHC
AND
- Self tolerant not to respond to self-peptides

32

33

T cell repertoire

Highly personalized as a result of positive and negative selection

This is due to the diversity of HLA types in the human population.

# Summary #1

1. What do T cells require to become mature T cells in the thymus?

**CD4** T cells require **MHC class II-peptide** complexes expressed on **thymic stromal cells**.

**CD8** T cells require **MHC class I-peptide** complexes expressed on **thymic stromal cells**.

2. What is the developmental pathway of thymocytes?

**DN** (CD4-CD8⁻); most immature thymocytes

**DP** (CD4⁺CD8⁺); intermediate stage and the most abundant population of thymocytes

**SP** (CD4⁺ or CD8⁺); matured and exit to the periphey

34

# Summary #2

3. What is positive and negative selection of T cells?

**Positive selection**: T cells bearing TCR that are *partially signaled* by *self-MHC with peptides* are rescued from apoptosis and matures.

**Negative selection**: T cells recognizing *self-peptide bound to self-MHC* with *high affinity* are deleted by apoptosis.

4. Why is T cell selection important?

To generate T cells that are *not self-reactive* (tolerant) and *recognize foreign peptides with self-MHC*.

5. What is the consequence of dysregulated T cell development?

Lack of functional T cells (immunodeficiencies) or production of autoreactive T cells (autoimmune diseases)

35

36

# Why does an individual express a limited number of different MHC molecules?

To educate developing T cells

37

A T cell repertoire of an individual is diverse enough to mediate a whole array of different immune reactions.

How can we achieve the diversity of T cells with a limited number of HLA?

38

A possible maximum number of peptides that can be bound by one MHC allele

In theory

- Let’s take MHC class I that binds a 9 aa long peptide
- Each position can have 20 different amino acid residues

Total peptides presentable by one MHC allele

20x20x20x20x20x20x20x20x20= 5.12x10¹¹

In reality

- Anchor residues; Both the position and identity restriction
- A smaller number of total MHC-peptide complexes

What would happen to the T cell repertoire, if you have a defect in the following molecules?

MHC class I
MHC class II
β2m
TAP

40

# Phenotype of the T cell repertoire

Any defect in proper expression of MHC class I on the cell surface
→ No CD8 T cells

Any defect in proper expression of MHC class II expression on the cell surface
→ No CD4 T cells
