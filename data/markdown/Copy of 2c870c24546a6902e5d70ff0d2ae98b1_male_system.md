IN SUMMARY
MALE SYSTEM

# MALE SYSTEM ANATOMY

## TESTIS

- Testis descends from a retroperitoneal position through the inguinal canal to take to scrotum during the eighth fetal month.
- Lower temperature required for spermatogenesis
- Countercurrent vascular heat exchange system
- Seminiferous tubules comprise 95% of testicular volume,
- 500 tubules per testis.
- Surrounded by the tough tunica albuginea.
- Seminiferous tubules -&gt; rete testis -&gt; epididymis -&gt; vas deferens -&gt; prostate -&gt; ejaculatory duct -&gt; urethra
- Seminal vesicle secretions join sperm in prostate
- Gonad undifferentiated at 8 weeks
- Influence of Y chromosome
- Wollfian duct -&gt; male
- MIS -&gt; regression of Mullerian ducts (uterus and fallopian tube in female)
- Testosterone to DHT by 5 alpha reductase causes masculinization of external genitalia

## SERTOLI CELLS

- Sertoli cells and germ cells make up the seminiferous tubules
- Tight junctions between Sertoli cells (blood-testis barrier)
- Sertoli cells separate germinal epithelium into basal and adluminal compartments.
- Single Sertoli cell envelopes up to 20 germ cells
- Sertoli cells: support and nutrition of germ cells, release of mature germ cells, secrete androgen binding protein, transferring, inhibin, cell-cell communication (gap junctions)

## GERM CELLS

- Spermatogonia – line basement layer of seminiferous tubules – small, round, mitotically active
- Develop into type B spermatogonia -&gt; primary spermatocytes during first meiotic division (tetraploid)
- Pre-leptotene, leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene
- Secondary spermatocytes result from first reduction division (diploid)
- Second meiotic division lasts a day and result in spermatids (haploid)
- Cells in any cluster are synchronized

## SPERMATOZOA

- Morphologically mature – highly polarized – 60 uM
- Condensed nucleus (acrosome) and membrane
- Tail – has neck, mid piece (sheath of mitochondria), principle piece, end piece
- 9+2 axoneme extends from neck to end piece
- Entire tail covered by plasma membrane

## LEYDIG CELLS

- Between seminiferous tubules
- Production of testosterone – local and distant purposes
- In testes, testosterone bound to androgen binding protein secreted by Sertoli cells
- In plasma, testosterone is bound to circulating testosterone binding globulin

## SEMEN

- Suspension of sperm in seminal plasma
- Seminal plasma: seminal vesicles, prostate and also bulbourethral gland (Cowper's), urethral glands (Littre), rete testis, epididymis, vas deferens, ampullae
- Seminiferous tubules drain to mediastinum testes and then into rete testis where 90% of fluid is produced
- 8-12 efferent ducts from rete testis to epididymis

IN SUMMARY
MALE SYSTEM

HST 071

# EPIDIDYMUS
- 20 meter long duct, pseudostratified columnar epithelium, cilia
- Sperm conduit, fluid resorption, sperm reservoir (cauda), sperm maturation (fertilizing ability and motility)

# VAS DEFERENS
- Continuation of epididymis
- Straight duct, pseudostratified columnar epithelium, cilia, 25-45 cm long
- Transport of sperm through scrotum, inguinal canal, behind base of bladder (ampullae)
- Thick muscular wall for rapid transport of sperm during ejaculation

# PROSTATE
- 20 grams

# EJACULATE
- 2-5 cc with 150-200 million sperm

# HORMONAL CONTROL OF SPERMEOGENESIS
- Testosterone (for germinal epithelium), FSH (stimulates Sertoli cells to make protein kinases and protein synthesis)
- LH stimulates Leydig cells to make testosterone
- GnRH made in hypothalamus – pulses every 70-90 minutes – half life 2-5 minutes
- Testosterone inhibits LH release from pituitary and GnRH release from hypothalamus
- Estradiol derived from aromatase conversion of testosterone
- Estradiol more potent inhibitor of LH and FSH
- FSH secretion down regulated by inhibin (made by Sertoli cells)

# SPERM PHYSIOLOGY
- Traverse female genital tract, bind to ova, penetrate zona pellucida, fuses with plasma membrane of ovum
- Fresh ejaculate is gel (made in seminal vesicles), liquefies in 5-20 minutes (by prostate protease)
- Fructose (seminal vesicles) is energy substrate for sperm
- Capacitation -&gt; acrosome reaction, release of lysosomal enzymes, alter plasma membrane of sperm head, affects sperms stickiness to egg, cause hypermotility, change in tail beat frequency

# MALE INFERTILITY EVALUATION
- History
- Prior history of infertility, timing of puberty, genital abnormalities, medications, prior surgery, chronic illness
- Physical exam
- Evidence of endocrine abnormalities-&gt;gynecomastia, hair pattern, phallus, urethral meatus, size and consistency of testes (4.5 cm diameter), vas deference, varicocele

# SEMEN ANALYSIS
- Volume 2-5 cc
- Sperm density &gt;20 million/cc (avg. 50-60)
- Motility &gt;60%
- Morphology Absence of WBC's, RBC's, bacteria, agglutination
- &gt;60% normal forms

# VARICOCELE
- Dilated pampiniform plexus, left side, 10-15% of all men, 50% of infertility patients

IN SUMMARY
MALE SYSTEM

- Abnormal thermoregulation
- Testes usually 20 degrees C cooler than core temperature
- Ligation of gonadal vein, improves sperm quality in 70% of men

# EJACULATION – ERECTION

- Emission (deposition of sperm into posterior urethra) and expulsion from urethra
- Under control of sympathetic nervous system
- Emission – contractions of vas, seminal vesicles and prostate
- Ejaculation – closure of bladder neck and contraction of periurethral muscles, bulbocavernosus
- Point and shoot

# ERECTION

- Neurologic initiation, reflex or centrally mediated
- Arterial filling of erectile bodies – corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum
- Venous occlusion of erectile bodies
- Flaccid state – resting sympathetic tone, small caliber cavernosal arteries and contracted muscle
- Signal for erection – relaxation of arterioles, increased caliber, relaxation of cervervosal sinusoids, venules are compressed by inflow of blood and increased intracorporal pressure causing reduced outflow
- When sympathetic tone returns the arteries constrict and the veins allow outflow

# VIAGRA AND SIMILAR DRUGS

- Sildenafil and many others
- NO (nitric oxide) released in corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation
- NO-&gt;guanylate cyclase-&gt;cGMP-&gt;smooth muscle relaxation-&gt;blood flow
- Sildenafil enhances effect of NO by inhibiting type 5 phosphodiesterase (degrades cGMP)
- Has no effect in absence of sexual stimulation
- Most potent effect on PDE5 (4000 times that for PDE3)
- Also affects PDE6 found in retina (color vision problems with high dose)
- Hepatic metabolism (cytochrome P450) – active metabolite
- Caution if using other P450 inhibitors (itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, ritonavir, cimetidine)
- Rapidly absorbed, maximum plasma concentration within 30-40 minutes
- Decrease in supine BP
