# THE EVALUATION OF CHEST PAIN

Key Words: Angina pectoris, pericarditis, aortic dissection, differential diagnosis

## Objectives:

1. To learn the differential diagnosis of chest pain.
2. To learn the key life threatening causes of chest pain.
3. To diagnose aortic dissection.
4. To become familiar with Bayes Theorem.

# CAUSES OF RECURRENT CHEST PAIN

- Cardiac
- Gastrointestinal
- Musculoskeletal
- Aortic
- Pulmonary
- Psychologic

# CARDIAC CHEST PAIN

- Angina Pectoris
- Retrosternal tightness
- Radiates to neck, jaw, shoulder or arms (L &gt; R)
- Brought on by:
- Exertion
- Emotion
- Lasts minutes (1 - 10 min)
- Relieved by NTG or rest
- EKG: Transient STE or ST depression

# CARDIAC CHEST PAIN

- Pericarditis
- Sharp pleuritic chest pain
- Worse lying; better sitting
- Friction rub heard on auscultation
- Lasts hours to days
- EKG: Typically PR depression and ST elevation

# GASTROINTESTINAL CHEST PAIN

Gastroesophageal Reflux: (GERD)

- Retrosternal burning
- Precipitated by foods or supine position (night-time)
- Relieved by antacids, not NTG

# GASTROINTESTINAL CHEST PAIN

## Peptic Ulcer Disease:

- Epigastric ache or burning
- After meals, not exertional
- Gnawing pain at night
- Relieved by antacids, not NTG

# GASTROINTESTINAL CHEST PAIN

## Esophageal Spasm:

- Retrosternal pain and dysphagia
- Precipitated by meals
- Not exertional
- May be relieved by NTG

# GASTROINTESTINAL CHEST PAIN

## Biliary Colic:

- Constant deep RUQ pain
- Brought on by fatty foods, not exertion
- Not relieved by antacids or NTG

# MUSCULOSKELETAL CHEST PAIN

## Costrochondritis:

- Sternal pain worsened by chest movement
- Costrochondral junctions sensitive to palpitation
- Worse on left side
- Relieved by antiinflammatory agent or steroid injection

# MUSCULOSKELETAL CHEST PAIN

## Cervical Radiculitis:

- Constant pain or shooting pains
- May be in dermatomal distribution
- Worsened by neck motion

# AORTIC CHEST PAIN

## Aortic Dissection:

- Sudden and severe at inception
- May be chest and/or back pain
- Pulse deficits or aortic valve insufficiency

# AORTIC CHEST PAIN

## Aortic Aneurysm:

- Deep steady pain located at site of pressure on musculoskeletal system
- May have cough, dysphagia, or other sx from local compression

# PULMONARY CHEST PAIN

## Pleurisy:
- Sharp pleuritic chest pain
- Worse lying; better sitting
- Pleural rub on exam
- Lasts hours or days
- Often with cough, respiratory infection

# PULMONARY CHEST PAIN

## Pulmonary Embolus:

- Sudden severe pain with SOB
- Pleuritic in nature
- Predisposition to venous clotting
- Hypoxia and tachycardia

# PSYCHOLOGIC CHEST PAIN

## Panic Disorder:

- Dull constricting ache with SOB
- Circumoral numbness or lightheadedness
- Recent unusual stress
- Recurrent episodes in healthy people

# DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN

|  TEST | TARGET DIAGNOSIS  |
| --- | --- |
|  EKG | • Myocardial ischemia  |
|  CXR | • Pericarditis  |
|  Upper GI series
or endoscopy | • Aortic dissection or
aneurysm  |
|   | • GERD  |
|   | • Ulcer  |

# DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN

|  TEST | TARGET DIAGNOSIS  |
| --- | --- |
|  Abdomen ultra sound | • Gall stones  |
|  Chest CT or MRI | • Aortic disease  |
|  Esophageal motility | • Pulmonary embolus  |
|  VQ scan/CT Angio | • Esophageal spasm  |
|  Stress test/CT Angio | • Pulmonary embolus  |
|   | • Angina  |

# DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN

2 - D Echo
- Pericardial fluid
- Aortic dissection

Transesophageal echo
- Aortic dissection

# APPLICATION OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS

## BAYE'S THEOREM

Probability → Test → Post test
Probability

# PROBABILITY OF MAJOR CAD IN PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN

|  Age | No Sx |   | Atypical Angina |   | Typical Angina  |   |
