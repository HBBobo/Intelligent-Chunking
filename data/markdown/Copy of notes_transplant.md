# Transplantation Self Study

- Basics
- Transplantation performed to replace non-functioning vital organ
- Risk include (not limited to) rejection and immunosuppressants--&gt;infection

- ABO Matching
- Mismatching leads to endothelial damage by ABO antibodies
- Subsequent widespread thrombosis and graft loss
- O cannot accept A, B, AB
- A cannot accept B, AB; B cannot accept A, AB
- AB an accept everything
- Hyperacute rejection
- w/in hours
- Antibody mediated
- Marked by expanded inflammatory infiltrate composed of mononuclear lymphocytes
- Acute and chronic rejection mediated by T cells

- MHC Rejection
- T cell mediated
- HLA molecules in MHC most important
- Syngeneic grafts (same donor/recipient) never rejected
- If HLA antigens not identical, T cells will react against foreign HLA molecules
- Matching
- HLA-identical siblings optimal
- Post-transplant immunosuppression required for all transplant pairs except identical twins
- MHC antigens
- Self proteins loaded into HLA peptide groove
- Even when HLA antigens identical, differences in self-peptides from donor organ can facilitate immune response
- Matching
- MHC matching sufficient but minor histocompatibility antigens not matched
- T cells clones recognizing allogenic MHC molecules are abundant
- Better matching results in lower likelihood of rejection and better response to immunosuppressants
- T cells for minor antigens less abundant and well controlled immunosuppressants

- Immunosuppression
- Increases risk of infection
- NSAIDs
- Reduce inflammation by inhibiting enzymes
- Aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, naproxen
- Corticosteroids
- Prednisone
- Inhibit antigen driven T cell differentiation by inhibiting expression of genes
- Lead to apoptosis of activated T cells
- Suppress action of inflammatory cells reducing both PG and LT synthesis and inhibiting emigration of leukocytes from blood vessels
- SE: fluid retention, weight gain, diabetes, bone mineral loss, thinning of skin
- Anti-metabolic drugs
- Azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate
- Act by killing all dividing cells
- Nucleoside analogs that inhibit nucleotide synthesis or by alkylating DNA

Lecture Page 47

Act by killing T cells and B cells undergoing antigen driven differentiation
SE: bone marrow stem cells, skin, hair follicles, epithelial cells in intestine, fetus

- Immunosuppressive drugs
- Prevent signaling that is important to antigen-dependent T and B cell differentiation
- Bind to cytoplasmic proteins that prevent signal transduction from T cell or Ig receptor via calcineurin (cyclosporin A and tacrolimus) or inhibit protein translation and progress through cell cycle (rapamycin)
- Cyclosporin A/tacrolimus lead to reduced expression of cytokines
- Rapamycin leads to T cell apoptosis
- Agents are very effective inhibitors of antigen-driven immune responses

- Combo of drugs usually used
- Using smaller doses but multiple groups inhibition is improved but w/ less side effects
- General immunosuppression still exists

- Matching
- Type for MHC expressed on leukocytes using antibodies
- Antibodies for a single allele difficult to obtain
- Many alleles cannot be typed w/ antibodies, esp. class II genes
- Type for MHC genes by PCR and sequencing
- Finds all potential differences
- Expensive and time consuming
- Method of choice if time not major issue

- Mixed Lymphocyte Rxn
- MLR is co-culture from two individuals
- Detects ability of T cells to recognize allogenic differences of WBC from another individual
- T cells divide after recognition
- Cell division can be measured by uptake of tritiated thymidine from culture media into cells
- Negative control is potential graft recipients rxn to his/her own lymphocytes
- Test is recipients lymphocytes reacting to donor's x-irradiated lymphocytes
- Differences in class II are key differences that result in thymidine uptake
- Sensitive measure of immunological recognition
- Availability of suitable reagents is not an issue
- Takes about a week and is expensive

- Bone Marrow Transplantation: Graft-versus-host disease also occurs
- Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: effective after transplantation b/c stem cells go to bone marrow and reconstitute all components of bone marrow
- GHVD caused by mature T cells that contaminate bone marrow or stem cell preparation
- Donor T cells recognize allogenic MHC molecules of host or minor HC antigens
- Initiate inflammatory immune response against host tissue
- Syngeneic &gt; Genotypic-identical sibling &gt; Other family member &gt; Matched unrelated donor
- The probability that any two unrelated persons will match is extremely low
- Broad application of this technique is made feasible by large volunteer registries

- Conditioning regimens
- Bone marrow transplant recipients undergo chemo/radiation to reduce GVHD chance
- Tumor burden w/ cytotoxic drugs
- Immunosuppress recipient to prevent rejection of bone marrow transplant

- Complications of transplant
- Toxicity from conditioning regiment: short and long term effects
- Graft rejection
- GVHD
- Acute
- ♦ Usu. Develops w/in first 100 d of transplant
- ♦ Primary tgts are skin, liver, intestines
- Chronic

- Clinically represents autoimmune disease
- Skin (scleroderma), dry eyes, mouth and vagina (sicca like syndrome), liver, GI, lungs, fasciitis, serositis
