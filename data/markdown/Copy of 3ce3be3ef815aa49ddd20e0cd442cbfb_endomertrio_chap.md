IN SUMMARY

ENDOMETRIOSIS

# ENDOMETRIOSIS

- Attachment of endometrial cells to the peritoneal surface
- Invasion of these cells into the mesothelium
- Recruitment of inflammatory cells
- Angiogenesis around the nascent implant
- Endometrial cellular proliferation

- Monkeys are only animal (cyclic)
- No cases reported prior to puberty
- Often seen in teenage years
- Short cycle and longer flows have twice the risk of endometriosis
- Early menarche
- Delayed childbearing
- Menstrual outflow obstruction

- Implantation (Sampson's theory)
- Viable endometrial tissue is refluxed through the fallopian tubes during menstruation
- Implants on peritoneal surface or pelvic organs

## Retrograde menstruation

- Occurs through the fallopian tubes
- Refluxed endometrial cells are viable
- Refluxed endometrial cells are able to adhere to peritoneum

## Coelomic Metaplasia

- Ovary &amp; Mullerian ducts derive from coelomic mesothelium
- Germinal epithelium attempts to recapitulate endometrium
- Only explains ovarian endometriosis
- Peritoneal mesothelium is totipotential
- Develops from metaplasia of cells that line the pelvic peritoneum
- Infectious, hormonal, or other inductive stimuli may result in metaplasia

## Dissemination

- Disseminated tissue can cause metaplasia
- Injection into ear vein of rabbit causes endometriosis of lungs
- Laparotomy scar
- Episiotomies
- Cesarean sections
- Transplantation confirmed in animal experiments

IN SUMMARY ENDOMETRIOSIS

## Embryonic rest theory

- Cell rests of Mullerian origin
- Lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination of endometrial cells
- Evidence suggests that endometrial cells can metastasize
- Pleura, umbilicus, retroperitoneal space, lower extremity, vagina, and cervix - are anatomically possible
- Endometrial tissue in uterine veins in women with adenomyosis
- Induced pulmonary endometriosis by injecting endometrial tissue intravenously in rabbits
- Lymph node endometriosis was found to be present in 6.7% autopsies

## Found In

- Bone
- Muscle
- Brain
- Nerve
- Lung parenchyma
- Vertebral space
- Extremities

## Genetics

- Much more common in patients with a FH
- Maternal inheritance pattern
- 7% in first degree relatives
- More severe in women with a + first degree relative
- 6/8 monozygotic twins had endometriosis
- 3.8% of non-monozygous sisters
- Polygenic/multifactorial
- No HLA system seems involved
- Perhaps different diseases

## Adherence

- Endometrial fragments obtained in either phase of the cycle – adhere to the epithelial side of the amnion but only at locations where the amniotic epithelium was damaged or absent
- Cultured peritoneal explants adhered to peritoneal explants only at locations where the mesothelium was absent or damaged and the basement membrane was exposed
- Intact mesothelium constitutes a defense barrier
- Occasionally there is attachment to intact mesothelium

## Integrins

- Intracellular adhesion molecule-1
- Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
- Integrin-blocking antibodies do not interfere with endometrial stromal or epithelial cell adherence to mesothelium

## Hyaluronic Acid

- Peritoneal mesothelium produces hyaluronic acid
- Hyaluronic acid is expressed along the cell membrane and contributes to the pericellular matrix
- Major component of the extracellular matrix ground substance
- CD44 is the principal receptor for hyaluronic acid
- Involved in binding of gastric cancer and ovarian cancer cells to mesothelium
- Endometrial stromal end epithelial cells express CD44
- Hyaluronidase pretreatment of mesothelial cells decreases the binding of endometrial stromal and epithelial cells to mesothelium

IN SUMMARY ENDOMETRIOSIS

HST 071

- Invasion follows initial adhesion
- Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes - implicated
- MMPs (and inhibitors) play a significant role in normal endometrial remodeling that accompanies menses
- MMP family contains several structurally related Zn++ dependent endopeptidases
- Responsible for the degradation of various extracellular matrix components
- collagen
- gelatins
- proteoglycans
- laminin
- fibronectin
- elastin

# TGF-β

- Produced by endometrial tissue in response to progesterone
- TGF-β suppresses expression of MMP-7
- Antibody to TGF-β abolishes this suppression
- Blocking the action of TGF-β opposes progesterone-mediated suppression of MMP-3 and MMP-7
- Blocks the ability of progesterone to prevent experimental endometriosis
- TGF-β alone does not lead to sustained suppression of MMPs
- Possibly because of resumption of MMP production in the absence of progesterone
- Consistent with the fact that peritoneal fluid levels of TGF-β are elevated in endometriosis

# IL-1α

- Potent stimulator of MMP-3 in proliferative phase endometrium
- Progesterone exposure in vivo reduces the IL-1α stimulation of MMP-3 in secretory phase tissue
- IL-1α stimulation of MMP-3 is restored in a dose-dependent manner with progesterone withdrawal
- Cultured endometriotic cells obtained from a rat endo model express higher levels of MMP-3 mRNA than eutopic rat endometrial stromal cells when treated with progesterone
- Elevated and persistent MMP-3 expression by endometriotic stromal cells cultured in the presence of progesterone correlates with elevated levels of IL-1α mRNA detected in the endometriotic stromal cells
- Production of IL-1α by the endometriotic lesions - overcomes the progesterone-induced suppression of MMP-3
- IL-1α - related mechanism promotes MMP-3 production by endometriotic cells even in the presence of progesterone

# Contributes to pain and infertility

- Cytokines
- Prostaglandins
- Dyspareunia
- Chronic pelvic pain
- Inflammation --&gt; Infertility
- adhesion formation
- scarring
- disrupt fallopian tube patency
- impair folliculogenesis
- fertilization
- embryo implantation

# Hormonal Dependence

- Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disorder
- Aberrant estrogen synthesis and metabolism –
- Aromatase catalyzes the synthesis of estrone and estradiol from androstenedione and testosterone, respectively
- Expressed by many human cell types
- Ovarian granulosa cells
- Placental syncytiotrophoblasts
- Adipose cells
- Skin fibroblasts
- Estrogen produced by aromatase activity in the cytoplasm of leiomyoma smooth muscle cells or endometriotic stromal cells
- Disease-free endometrium and myometrium lack aromatase expression

# Aromatase

- Cultured stromal cells derived from endometriotic implants and incubated with a CAMP analog display extraordinarily high levels of aromatase
- Growth factors, cytokines - possible inducers of aromatase
- Prostaglandin E2 was identified as the most potent inducer
- Estrogen - up-regulates prostaglandin E2 formation
- Stimulates cyclo-oxygenase type 2 enzyme in endometrial stromal cells
- Positive feedback loop for continuous local estrogen and prostaglandin E2 production
- Possible genetic defect in aromatase expression in endo
- Androstenedione of adrenal and ovarian origins – premenopausal women
- Adrenal androstenedione in postmenopausal women
- Estrone - weakly estrogenic
- Must be converted to estradiol
- 17α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17α-HSD) type 1 is expressed in endometriosis
- In contrast 17α-HSD type 2 inactivates estradiol by catalyzing its conversion to estrone in eutopic endometrial glandular cells during the luteal phase
- Progesterone induces the activity of 17α-HSD
- Inactivation of estradiol to estrone one of the anti-estrogenic properties of progesterone
- 17α-HSD type 2 is absent from endometriotic glandular cells
