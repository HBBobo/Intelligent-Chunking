# Muscle Tissue

I. Striated Muscle - regularly arranged contractile units
A. Skeletal Muscle - long, cylindrical multinucleated cells with peripherally placed nuclei. Contraction is typically quick and vigorous and under voluntary control. Used for locomotion, mastication, and phonation.
B. Cardiac Muscle - elongated, branched cells with a single centrally placed nucleus and intercalated discs at the ends. Contraction is involuntary, vigorous, and rhythmic.

II. Smooth Muscle - possesses contractile machinery, but it is irregularly arranged (thus, non-striated). Cells are fusiform with a central nucleus. Contraction is involuntary, slow, and long lasting.

# Skeletal Muscle Investments

Epiimysium - dense irr. c.t.
Perimysium - less dense irr. c.t.
Endomysium - basal lamina and reticular fibers

T-tubule System: Propagation of the Signal and Release of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$

T (transverse) Tubules
- run perpendicular (transversely) to myofibrils
- conduct membrane depolarization deep into fibers

Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
- smooth ER
- site of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ storage &amp; release
- terminal cisternae abut T-tubules forming triads when myofibrils are viewed in longitudinal section

# Longitudinal section of muscle showing triads

- 1 T tubule
- 2 terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum

# Neuromuscular Junction

## Synapse:
- Action potential (AP) stimulates release of acetylcholine from axon terminal into synaptic cleft
- Acetylcholine in synaptic cleft binds Na⁺ channel receptors –initiates sarcolemma AP

## Signal Propagation:
### T (transverse) Tubules
- Run perpendicular (transversely) to myofibrils
- Conduct membrane depolarization deep into fibers

## Intracellular Ca²⁺ release:
### Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
- Smooth ER, site of Ca²⁺ storage
- Voltage-gated channels in SR detect membrane depolarization in T-tubule and release Ca²⁺

# $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ Stimulates Myosin-Actin Binding and Initiates Contraction

- Myosin-actin binding inhibited by TnI
- TnC binds Ca²⁺ (if present) and induces release of TnI from actin
- Myosin binds actin; hydrolysis of ATP induces power stroke
- Actin filaments move relative to myosin

# Contraction Cycle

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

1. ATP binds myosin – myosin releases actin
2. ATP hydrolysis induces conformational change – myosin head cocks forward 5nm (ADP+Pᵢ remain bound to myosin).
3. Myosin binds weakly to actin, causing release of Pᵢ
4. Release of Pᵢ induces strong binding, power stroke, and release of ADP

Myosin remains bound to actin if no more ATP is available (rigor conformation)

# Sliding Filament Theory

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

Note: Z lines move closer together; I band and H band become smaller during contraction

## Muscle fibers are composed of many contractile units (sarcomeres)

Changes in the amount of overlap between thick and thin filaments allows for contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers

Many fibers contracting together result in gross movement

# Cardiac Muscle

## Tissue Features:
- Striated (same contractile machinery)
- Self-excitatory and electrically coupled
- Rate of contractions modulated by autonomic nervous system
- innervation is neuroendocrine in nature (i.e. no "motor end plates")

## Cell Features:
- 1 or 2 centrally placed nuclei
- Branched fibers with intercalated discs
- Numerous mitochondria (up to 40% of cell volume)
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum &amp; T-tubules appear as diads at Z lines
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum does not form terminal cisternae
- T tubules are about 2x larger in diameter than in skeletal muscle
- transport Ca²⁺ into fibers

# Ultrastructure of Smooth Muscle:

- actin and myosin filaments
- intermediate filaments of desmin (also vimentin in vascular smooth muscle)
- membrane associated and cytoplasmic dense bodies containing α actinin (similar to Z lines)
- relatively active nucleus (smooth muscle cells make collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans)

# More Ultrastructure of Smooth Muscle Cells:

- actin filament (arrowheads)
- intermediate filaments
- dense bodies (desmin/vimentin plaques)
- caveoli (membrane invaginations &amp; vesicular system contiguous with SER –functionally analogous to sarcoplasmic reticulum)

PC·INEL

Cross and Mercer. Inset of plate 114.

# Smooth Muscle Contraction:

also Ca+ dependent, but mechanism is different than striated muscle

1. Ca2+ ions released from caveloae/SER and complex with calmodulin
2. Ca2+-calmodulin activates myosin light chain kinase
3. MLCK phosphorylates myosin light chain
4. Myosin unfolds &amp; binds actin; ATP-dependent contraction cycle ensues.
5. Contraction continues as long as myosin is phosphorylated.
6. "Latch" state: myosin head attached to actin dephosphorylated causing decrease in ATPase activity – myosin head unable to detach from actin (similar to "rigor mortis" in skeletal muscle).

## Triggered by:

- Voltage-gated Ca+ channels activated by depolarization
- Mechanical stimuli
- Neural stimulation
- Ligand-gated Ca+ channels

![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

PD-TNEL

Ross and Pawlina. Figure 11.23.

# Mechanics of Smooth Muscle Contraction

- Dense bodies are analogous to Z lines (plaques into which actin filaments insert)
- Myosin heads oriented in "side polar" arrangement
- Contraction pulls dense bodies together

## Additional notes:

- Contraction cycle generally about ~10% as fast as skeletal muscle
- Visceral (unitary) smooth muscle cells may be electrically coupled via gap junctions and exhibit either rhythmic or tonic contraction – innervation generally MODIFIES smooth muscle activity rather than initiating it.
- Multiunit smooth muscle cells are innervated individually and can contract rapidly for more precise control.
- Innervation is always at a distance (no motor end plates)

# Muscle Regeneration and Growth

## Skeletal Muscle
- Increase in size (hypertrophy)
- Increase in number (regeneration/proliferation)
- Satellite cells are proposed source of regenerative cells

## Smooth Muscle
- Increase in size (hypertrophy)
- Increase in number (regeneration/proliferation)
- Smooth muscle cells are proliferative
(e.g. uterine myometrium and vascular smooth muscle)
- Vascular pericytes can also provide source of smooth muscle

## Heart Muscle
- Increase in size (hypertrophy)
- Formerly thought to be non-proliferative
- Post-infarction tissue remodeling by fibroblasts (fibrosis/scarring)
- New evidence suggests mitotic cardiomyocytes and regeneration by blood or vascular-derived stem cells

# Learning Objectives

1. Be able to identify the three types of muscle at the light and electron microscope levels, including distinctive features of each, such as the intercalated disk of cardiac muscle.

2. Be able to describe the structural basis of muscle striation.

3. Know the structural elements that harness muscle contraction (i.e., the shortening of myofibrils) to the movement of a body part (i.e., via connection to bone) as well as the mechanism by which muscle cells contract.

4. Understand the function and organization of the connective tissue in muscle (endo-, peri-, and epiysium).

5. Be familiar with the regenerative potential of each muscle type.
