## Acute Coronary Syndromes

|  Unstable angina | Non-ST Elevation MI
(Non-Q-wave MI) | ST-Elevation MI
(Q-wave MI)  |
| --- | --- | --- |

The continuum of acute coronary syndromes ranges from unstable angina, through non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (also referred to as “non-Q-wave” myocardial infarction [MI]), to ST-elevation MI (also referred to as “Q-wave” MI).

# Normal Hemostasis

Vessel wall injury

- 1st defense → Platelets
- “Primary hemostasis” → Platelet plug
- 2nd defense → Subendothelial
- Tissue factor activates plasma
- Coagulates proteins
- “Secondary hemostasis” → Fibrin clot

# Endogenous Antithrombotic Mechanisms

## Inactivation of clotting factors
- Antithrombin III
- Protein C / Protein S / thrombomodulin
- Tissue factor pathway inhibitor

## Lysis of fibrin clots
- Tissue plasminogen activator

## Endogenous platelet inhibition &amp; vasodilation
- Prostacyclin
- Nitrous oxide

# Endogenous Protective Mechanisms

# Causes of Acute Coronary Syndromes

- Atherosclerosis with superimposed thrombus
- Vasculitic syndromes
- Coronary emboli (e.g., from endocarditis, artificial valves)
- Congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries
- Coronary trauma or aneurysm
- Severe coronary artery spasm (primary or cocaine-induced)
- Increased blood viscosity (e.g., polycythemia vera, thrombocytosis)
- Significantly increased myocardial oxygen demand (e.g., aortic stenosis)

# Extent of Myocardial Injury

Determined by:

- LV mass perfused by vessel
- Magnitude/Duration of flow ↓
- Oxygen demand of affected tissue
- Adequacy of collaterals
- Tissue response to ischemia

# Clinical Features: ACS

# Serum Markers of Myocardial Infarction

- Myocardial necrosis causes sarcolemma disruption
- Intracellular macromolecules are released
- Can be measured by serial blood testing
- Pattern and level of rise correlates with timing and size of MI

# Cardiac-Specific Troponins

- Regulatory protein that controls interaction between actin &amp; myosin
- 3 subunits: TnC, I, T
- Skeletal &amp; cardiac muscle
- Unique cardiac troponins I and T exist - absent in serum of healthy people
- Powerful marker of myocyte damage
- Rise at 3-4 hours post-MI, peak 18-36 hrs, decline slowly 10-14 days

# Creatinine Kinase

- Enzyme that converts ADP to ATP
- Found in many tissues: heart, brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, etc.
- Can be elevated after injury to any of these tissues
- 3 isoenzymes:
- CK-MM
- CK-MB
- CK-BB

# CPK-MB

- Makes up 1-3% of skeletal CK
- Makes up much higher % of cardiac CK
- Rises 4-8 hours after MI, peaks by 24 hours
- Returns to normal in 48-72 hours

PD-INEL

# Nitrates

- Reduce ischemia (not mortality)
- Venodilation: ↓ R heart return
- Coronary vasodilation
- Usually given SL then IV

# Beta Blockers

- ↓ Sympathetic drive; HR &amp; BP
- ↓ O₂ demand
- ↓ Shear stress
- ↓ Sudden death, death, recurrent MI

# Non Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers

- ↓ Heart rate

# Non - STE ACS:

Conservative vs. Early
Invasive Approach

# Early Invasive

- Urgent catheterization performed after initial medical Rx
- Allows rapid identification &amp; Rx of critical CAD
- More PCI/CABG

# Conservative

- Cath patients with recurrent ischemia in hospital
- Cath patients with inducible ischemia on pre-discharge stress test

# Invasive vs. Conservative

- Recent clinical trials show less infarction/ reinfarction &amp; possibly death with invasive strategy
- Especially in higher risk patients:
- ST segment deviation
- Elevated biomarkers
- Multiple risk factors... esp. DM

# Acute Treatment: STE MI

- Reperfusion: Thrombolysis vs. PTCA
- ASA
- O₂
- Beta blockers
- Nitrates
- ACE inhibitors
- Morphine
- Anticoagulants

Myocardial Infarction

# Recurrent Ischemia

- Angina or ischemia confers increase risk for reinfarction
- Should lead to angiography and revascularization for most pts.

# Arrhythmias in Acute MI

|  Rhythm | Cause  |
| --- | --- |
|  • Sinus Bradycardia | - ↑Vagal tone  |
|   | - ↓SA nodal artery perfusion  |
|  • Sinus Tachycardia | - CHF  |
|   | - Volume depletion  |
|   | - Pericarditis  |
|   | - Chronotrophic drugs (e.g. Dopamine)  |
|  • APB’s, atrial fib, VPB’s, VT, VF | - CHF  |
|   | - Atrial Ischemia  |
|   | - Ventricular ischemia  |
|   | - CHF  |
|  • AV block (1°, 2°, 3°) | - IMI: ↑ Vagal tone and ↓AV nodal artery flow  |
|   | - AMI: Extensive destruction of conduction tissue  |

# Blood Supply in the Conduction System

|  Conduction Pathway | Primary Arterial Supply  |
| --- | --- |
|  SA node | - RCA (70% of patients)  |
|  AV node | - RCA (85% of patients)  |
|  Bundle of His | - LAD (septal branches)  |
|  RBB | - Proximal portion by LAD
- Distal portion by RCA  |
|  LBB |   |
|  Left anterior fascicle | - LAD  |
|  Left posterior fascicle | - LAD and PDA  |

# Myocardial Dysfunction

- Cardiogenic Shock
- Depressed CO
- Hypotension
- Poor perfusion of vital organs
- Treatment: Look/Treat reversible cause
- Inotropes/vasodilators/IABP

# Cardiogenic Shock - MI - 1Y

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Shock (JS Hochman et al.) JAMA 2001; 285:190

# RV Infarction

- Common in IMI’s
- Sx/signs:
- Hypotension
- Increase RA Pressure
- Rx:
- Volume, hemodynamic monitoring...PA line

# Papillary Muscle Infarction

- “Common” in inferoposterior MI
- Leads to acute mitral valve regurgitation
- Left heart failure/pulmonary edema
- Rx: Coronary revascularization; IABP; valve repair

# Free Wall Rupture

- More likely in elderly, HTN, women
- Usually rapidly fatal
- Occasional walls off to form pseudoaneurysm
- Urgent surgery is best chance

# Ventricular Septal Defect

- Heralded by left to right shunting at ventricular level
- RV volume overload
- Loud systolic murmur over sternum
- Usually requires surgical repair

# True Ventricular Aneurysm

- Occurs late
- More often in non-reperfused STE MI’s
- Complications: Clot, CHF, arrhythmias

# Pericarditis

- More common in non-reperfused STE MI
- Fever, sharp pain with pleuritic tendency, friction rub
- Treatment: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent; heparin relatively contraindicated

# Thromboembolism

- Clot forms on infarcted akinetic myocardium
- Most common in large anterior MI
- Can cause embolic stroke
- Rx: 3-6 months anticoagulants
- If clot seen on echo or LVEF &lt; 30% or if large anterior MI

# Post MI Risk Stratification and Management

|  Predictor of Poor Outcome | Method to Detect | Treatment  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Poor LVEF | Echocardiogram | ACE, BB  |
|  Residual Ischemia | Pre D/C ETT | Cath; ASA,BB  |
|   | Max ETT later |   |
|  Arrhythmias | Monitoring/Observation | Directed  |

# Standard Discharge Rx

- ASA; clopidogrel
- Beta blocker
- ACE for CHF; LVEF ≤ 40%, perhaps all
- Warfarin as noted
- Cardiac Rehab
- PRN Nitrates
- Exercise prescription
- Low fat diet
- Smoking Cessation
- Statin if LDL cholesterol ≥ 100 mg/dl

# Kaplan-Meier Cumulative Risk of the Primary Outcome, Stratified According to GRACE Risk Score at Baseline
