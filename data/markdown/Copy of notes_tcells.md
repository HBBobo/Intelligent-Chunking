# T Cell Antigen Receptor

## TCR Structure

- Membrane anchored heterodimeric glycoprotein (α/β chains)
- Both chains have V and C domains
- Structurally related to V/C domains of Ig (β-pleated)
- V domain involved in antigen binding
- Three HV regions/chain = CDR 1-3
- Located in loops
- Directly involved w/ antigen binding
- Short cytoplasmic tails
- Overall similarity of TCR to Fab fragment of antibodies
- Many different α/β chains expressed w/in a single individual
- Each T cell expresses just one α/β chain --&gt; clonally distributed

## TCR Genes

- Assembled by somatic DNA recombination during T cell development in thymus
- No somatic hypermutation or isotype switching
- Never secreted
- SCID
- Loss of T/B cell function
- Deficient expression of RAGs involved in VDJ joining
- Omenn's syndrome
- Loss of T and B cell fxn; B cells more severely affected
- Caused by missense RAG mutations resulting in reduced activity
- α gene
- Encoded by rearranged V and J gene segments
- Random recombination
- RNA splicing fuses VJ to C
- β gene
- V, D, J gene segments
- Single cluster of V genes, two clusters of D, J, C genes
- D to J joining occurs first followed by recombination to any of a large number of V genes
- RNA splicing fuses VDJ to C
- Generation of TCR Diversity
- Multiple Vα/β - CDR1,2,3
- Multiple Jα/β - CDR3
- Combinatorial V-J joining/V-D-J - CDR3
- N-nucleotide addition at VJ/VDJ jxns - CDR3

## TCR Complex

- Found w/ CD3 and TCRβ transmembrane proteins - do not differ btw receptors
- Three CD3 proteins: γ, δ, ε form heterodimers that associate w/ TCR
- ε-δ
- ε-γ
- CD3δ and ε required for transport of TCR to cell surface
- ζ chain associates w/ TCR as homodimer
- CD3 and ζ chain relay signals from TCR to cytoplasm
- Contain ITAMs (tyrosine) that get phosphorylated to trigger intracellular signaling cascades

## T Cell Antigen Recognition

- Peptide fragments of antigens on surface of other cells in complex w/ MHC molecules

Lecture Page 21

- MHC restriction
- TCR recognizes only the right MHC and right antigen
- Learned w/ development
- MHC I
- Has α1,2,3 and β2 microglobulin
- CD8 (killer) T cells recognize + peptide
- Cell cytosol
- MHC II
- Has α1,2, β1,2 domains
- w/ peptide, recognized by CD4 (helper)
- CD4/CD8 interaction sites distinct from TCR interaction sites
- TCR and CD4 or CD8 are capable of recognizing the same MHC/peptide complex simultaneously
- CD4 and CD8 facilitate signal transduction
- TCR γ-δ receptor
- Minority of T cells
- Genes similarly organized to α/β genes
- Assembled by somatic DNA recombination
- δ locus embedded within α gene (deleted when α rearrangements occur)
- γ locus on separate chromosome
