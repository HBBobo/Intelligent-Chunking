Phagocytic Cells: Mechanisms of Bacterial Killing and Tissue Injury

Tuesday, February 12, 2008
9:00 AM

- Phagocytic Cells
- Lymphocytes - 30% of WBC - Viral defenses - mostly nucleus, slightly larger than RBC
- Granulocytes - 70% of WBC - bacterial defenses
- Neutrophils - 60% - multi lobed nucleus, granules
- Eosinophils - 3% - parasites, allergic asthma
- Basophils - 1% - blue in slides b/c of basic granules
- Monocytes - 6% - big, kidney bean shaped nucleus
- Monocytes --&gt; Macrophages in tissue
- Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids
- Spleen has lots of WBCs too

- Neutrophils and Macrophages
- Functions
- Ingest foreign material
- Kill bacteria and other microbes
- Degrade necrotic tissue and foreign antigens
- If there for too long, can cause tissue damage
- Neutrophil Recruitment
- Tissue injury leads to inflammatory mediator and chemoattractant release
- Inflammatory mediators make endothelium more sticky and permeable for cells to pass through (localization and migration)
- Chemoattractants set up gradient that recruits neutrophils to site (localization)
- Neutrophils can phagocytose, produce oxidants, release lysosomal granules
- NADPH oxidase activation via min electron transport system
- Lysosomal granule fusion: degranulation
- Most chemoattractants work via GPCR or Tyrosine Kinase signal transduction
- Opsonization and Phagocytosis
- Fc receptors for antibody
- Complement receptors: C3b binding
- Other receptors: receptors for collectins (mannose binding protein)
- Neutrophil has receptors for opsonins that bind and then form phagosome --&gt; phagolysosome
- Once bacterium is in, NADPH oxidase makes H2O2 from O2 via O2- (superoxide anion)
- w/o NADPH oxidase --&gt; chronic granulomatous disease of childhood
- Respiratory increase due to NADPH oxidase activity seen
- Elastase/collegenase break down bacteria
- Myeloperoxide converts H2O2 to HOCl (bleach)
- NO synthase: makes NO radical from Arg --&gt; vasodilation, intracellular cytotoxic agent, neurotransmitter; can be converted to make OH radicals or peroxynitrates

- Targets of Neutrophil Products
- Targets of Oxidants
- Unsaturated lipids: LOOH
- Proteins: sulfhydryls, methionine, tyrosine
- Nucleic acids
- Degranulation
- Bactericidal proteins
- Proteases
- Serine proteases (elastase)
- Metalloproteinases (collegnase, gelatinase)

- Acid hydrolases
- Oxidants/Proteases must be in balance w/ Antioxidants/Antiproteases
- Protective mechanisms
- Specific enzymes
- ☐ Superoxide dismutase: takes superoxide anion and makes hydrogen peroxide
- ☐ Catalase: converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen
- ☐ Glutathione peroxidase: takes peroxides and makes water, oxidized glutathione, and lipid-OH from LOOH
- Non-specific scavengers
- ☐ Vitamin E
- ☐ Vitamin C
- ☐ β-carotene
- Anti-proteases
- α-1-antiprotease (anti-trypsin) - in liver
- ♦ Plasma protein
- ♦ Binds proteases including elastase
- ♦ Inactivated by oxidants
- ♦ HOCl or metalloproteinases
- α-2-macroglobulin
- ♦ Plasma protein
- ♦ Binds proteases
- TIMPs
- ♦ Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
- ♦ Cell derived
