B cell development and activation

Tuesday, February 12, 2008
11:00 AM

- Toll-like receptors
- Recognize bacteria and viruses in innate immunity
- Bind to pattern molecules not expressed by humans but shared by groups of pathogens
- Expressed by many cells, including leukocytes
- Consequences of TLR signaling
- Production of cytokines and chemokines and subsequent inflammation
- Production of type I interferons
- Killing or inhibition of viruses and intracellular bacteria
- Up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules that help activate T and B lymphocytes
- NOD receptors
- Expressed in cytoplasm --&gt; viral defense
- Contain nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain

- Cells associated w/ innate immunity
- Macrophages and neutrophils
- "B1" B cells - make most of the antibodies in serum; bind to common epitopes
- Dendritic cells
- γ-δ T cells
- NK T cells
- Lymphocytes slightly larger and more granular than T and B lymphocytes
- Kill cells that do not express MHC class I molecules
- Some have Fc receptor to bind antibody and kill cell (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity)

- B Cell Differentiation
- Occurs in bone marrow from pluripotent stem cells
- Stem Cell has nothing on it
- Pro B cell gains CD19, CD20, other CD antigens
- Cluster of differentiation
- Found on groups of cells at same stage of differentiation
- CD45 on all cells, but can be as specific as CD8+ T cells (killer T)
- Can be used to define state of development of a cell
- Detected by monoclonal antibodies
- Flow Cytometry (FACS) - expression of a cell surface molecule
- Binds an antibody tagged w/ fluorescent molecule to a cell surface molecule
- Analyze amount of antibody bound
- Laser beam aimed at stream of fluid w/ three detectors
- Forward scatter - how big
- Side scatter - granulation
- Emission spectrum - amount of antibody on cell
- Each cell is represented as one dot
- CD19 vs. IgM graphs on pg80
- Early pro-B cell undergoes D-J rearrangement on H chain
- Late pro-B cell undergoes V-DJ rearrangement on H chain
- Pre B cell has μ chain in cytoplasm
- Pre B cell receptor
- Positive signaling w/ μ heavy chain only
- H chain is VDJ rearranged, begin light chain gene management
- Small pre B cell undergoes V-J rearrangement of L chain
- Immature B cell has IgM on surface

Lecture Page 14

Lecture Page 15

- VJ rearranged on L chains, VDJ rearranged on H chain
- Expression of IgM receptors
- Bruton's agammaglobulinemia
- ☐ x-linked disease
- ☐ Failure to produce antibodies
- ☐ Repeated infections
- ☐ Almost no production of B cells in bone marrow
- Mutation in Bruton's tyr kinase activated upon engagement of the pre B cell receptor
- Signal from μ on surface of pre B cells doesn't reach nucleus - positive signaling fails

○ Mature B cell has IgD and IgM on cell surface
- B cell development depends on adherent cell part of bone marrow and cytokines (IL-7) --&gt; B cell development requires a signal
- Final product is naïve
- Antigen independent B cell differentiation in bone marrow results in 10 mm diff clones of B cells each w/ different epitope (receptor repetoire)
- Each antibody is made by one clone of B cells hence immunoglobulins are clonally distributed

○ Immature B cells w/ an Ig that binds to a self antigen sends negative signal
- Results in deletion of immature B cells in bone marrow
- Clonal deletion - part of self-tolerance for B cells

○ Allelic exclusion
- In a b cell clone only one of two antibody loci is expressed
- A B cell could express two heavy chains and four light chains (κ and α), it only expresses one of each

○ Where does the B cell diversity come from?
- Constant region - one gene; if there were two genes, single amino acid changes would occur and there would soon be two isotypes
- Variable region - many genes for the three kinds of variable regions
- Vκ encodes aa 1-95
- 1500 kb of DNA; 79 genes
- Half are pseudogenes
- V genes are 5 to 20 kb apart
- Most 3' Vκ is 23 kb 5' of Cκ
- Jκ encodes aa 96-107
- 5 regions
- Lies 1.2 kb 5' of Cκ
- Cκ encodes aa 108-214
- Recombination Signal Sequences
- Each V is followed by: V codon 95CACAGTG--spacer--GGTTTTTGT
- Each J preceded by: ACAAAAACC--spacer-CACTGTG-J codon 96
- True for variable regions and J segments associated w/ heavy chain, κ and λ light chain genes
- V(D)J recombination mediated by lymphoid recombination activating genes: RAG1/2
- Mutation in genes lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (no B or T cells) or Omenn's syndrome (milder)
