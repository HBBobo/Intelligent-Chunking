- fibers and ground substance (extracellular matrix)

3. Functions:
- Architectural framework of the body
- Bind together and provide mechanical support for other tissue (metabolic, defense, transport, storage)
- Wound repair / inflammatory response

# Fibers in Connective Tissue

- Collagen
- most abundant protein in human body (up to 30% dry weight)
- multiple types: fibril-forming or fibril-associated (in skin, tendon, cartilage, bone, dentin, blood vessels); cross-linked networks (in all basement membranes)

- Reticular Fibers – specialized type of collagen (Type III; reticulin) associated with smooth muscle in organs subjected to changes in volume, forms the stroma in lymphatic and hematopoietic organs

- Elastic Fibers – thin fibers or fenestrated sheets composed of various glycoproteins, including the protein elastin, providing elastic properties to tissues that experience repeated deformation (in skin, blood vessels, lung, bladder)

# Major Collagen Fiber Types (out of at least 20)

|  Collagen Type | Tissues | Function  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Fibril-forming collagens (these are visible)  |   |   |
|  I
(most abundant) | Skin, tendon, bone, dentin | Resistance to tension  |
|  II | Cartilage, vitreous of eye | Resistance to pressure  |
|  III
(reticulin) | Skin, muscle, blood vessels, liver, etc. | Structural framework and stability  |
|  Network-forming collagens  |   |   |
|  IV | All basement membranes | Support and filtration  |
|  Fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT)  |   |   |
|  VI, IX | Assoc. w/ type I and II fibrils | Fibril-fibril / fibril-ECM binding  |
|  Anchoring filament collagens  |   |   |
|  VII | Epithelia | Epidermis to basal lamina  |

# Reticular (Reticulin) Fibers

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

- Form a delicate supporting framework for highly cellular tissues (endocrine glands, lymph nodes, liver, bone marrow, spleen, smooth muscle).
- Composed mainly of Type III collagen, with a carbohydrate moiety that reduces Ag+ to metallic sliver = argyrophilic
- Special stain: silver impregnation to visualize.
- Thinner than type I collagen (Type III fibrils are 30-40 nm diameter; type I fibrils are ~200 nm diameter)

# Noncollagen Components of the Extracellular Matrix

- Elastin
- "Ground substance"
- Glycosaminoglycans (GAG's)
- Proteoglycans
- Multiadhesive matrix proteins
- laminin
- fibronectin

# Elastic Fibers

LM: Visualized by selectively staining with **Weigert's** resorcin-fuchsin, or aldehyde-fuchsin

EM: Consist of amorphous core of **elastin** surrounded by microfibrillar glycoprotein, **fibrillin** (8-10nm).

**Elastin**: is rich in glycine and proline, but it contains little or no hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. uniquely contains **desmosine** and **isodesmosine**, which are thought to cross-link the molecules into a network of randomly coiled chains. This cross-linking is responsible for its rubber-like properties.

**Confers elasticity**: present in large amounts in ligaments, lung, skin, bladder, and walls of blood vessels.

**Marfan Syndrome**: defect in elastic fiber synthesis; reduced elasticity in skin and lungs, skeletal defects (bones are longer and thinner than usual), cardiovascular complications (aneurism, valve prolapse)

# Network of elastin molecules can stretch and recoil like a rubber band

elastin stain (“Weigert’s”, “aldehyde fuchsin”, “Verhoeff”): elastic fibers are purple/black

collagen fibers stain orange/pink or blue/green depending on other stains used (von Gieson’s or trichrome, respectively)

# Ground Substance of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM)

## 1. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG)
- linear (unbranched) polysaccharides, e.g. heparan sulfate, condroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid
- very hydrophilic due to abundant negative charges (e.g. $\mathrm{SO}_4^-$ groups).
- except for hyaluronic acid, are usually bound covalently to protein core as part of a proteoglycan

## 2. Proteoglycans
- core protein + GAG side chains (like a bottle brush)
- bind cells, other proteins, and/or ECM components

## 3. Multiadhesive glycoproteins
- small glycosylated proteins containing NUMEROUS binding sites to cells, signaling molecules, and other ECM components
- e.g. fibronectin and laminin: important for adhesion of epithelial cells to the basal lamina via transmembrane integrin receptors.

# Basement Membrane – Collagen Types IV, VII, and III

- Basement membranes are sheets of extracellular matrix proteins located at the interface of parenchyma (epithelia, endothelia, muscle, nerves, adipocytes) and connective tissue / ECM.
- Main constituents are glycosaminoglycans (heparan sulfate), fibrous proteins (collagen types IV, VII, III), structural glycoproteins fibronectin, laminin and entactin.
- This is NOT a plasma membrane.

# Basement membranes vary in thickness

## fibroreticular lamina basal lamina

1. lamina lucida (LL) or rara 10-50 nm
2. lamina densa (LD) 20-300 nm (type IV collagen)
3. Fibroreticular lamina (FL) merges with underlying CT (type III* and type VII collagen fibrils)

*basement membranes can also be visualized with silver stain

So, the “basement membrane” is the basal lamina + the fibroreticular lamina

# Fibroblasts are the most common cells in connective tissue

- Synthesize and secrete components of the ECM: fibers and ground substance.
- Active and quiescent stages (when quiescent sometimes called fibrocytes or mature fibroblasts).
- Synthesize growth factors.
- Rarely undergo cell division unless tissue is injured, which activates the quiescent cells.
- Play a major role in the process of wound healing and respond to an injury by proliferating and enhanced fiber formation.

Metachromasia – when stained with toluidine blue, the granules bind the dye and change its color to red.

- Principal function is storage in secretory granules and REGULATED release (degranulation) of histamine and other vasoactive mediators of inflammation.
- Responsible for the immediate hypersensitivity response characteristic of allergies, asthma and anaphylactic shock.
- Connective tissue mast cells are found in skin (dermis) and peritoneal cavity mucosal mast cells are in the mucosa of the digestive and respiratory tracts.

- Enter connective tissue from blood vessels as the "first wave" in acute inflammatory responses

# Types of Connective Tissue Proper

**Loose (areolar)** **connective tissue** – delicate, vascularized, *cellular*; supports the epithelia of the major organs and glands and fills the space between muscle tissue. - not very resistant to stress

**Dense connective tissue** *(many more fibers than cells)*

- **Dense irregular**: meshwork of coarse fibers; dermis of skin, organ capsules, fascia - resists multi-directional forces

- **Dense regular**:
- collagenous: fibers aligned in defined pattern; tendons, ligaments, etc. - resists linear mechanical stresses
- elastic: elastin and microfibrils (fibrillin) - elasticity

**Adipose** - fat storage, glucose regulation, satiety

**Reticular** - argyrophilic fibers of type III collagen - forms stroma of highly cellular organs (e.g. liver, lymph nodes, spleen)

# Loose connective tissue:

delicate, vascularized, flexible; facilitates transport of cells and materials (secretion, absorption, immunity)

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this session, you should be able to:

1. Describe the functions and identify the cells commonly found in connective tissue.
2. Recognize interstitial (fibrillar) collagens and elastic fibers at the light and electron microscopic levels.
4. Distinguish between elastic, type I collagen, type III (reticular) collagen, and elastic fibers when appropriately stained material is presented.
6. Use knowledge about the physical characteristics of collagen and elastin in explaining the functions of tissue where these molecules occur in large quantities (e.g., coarse type I collagen fibrils present in dense connective tissue compared to more delicate type III fibers found closer to the interface of cells and the extracellular matrix).
8. Recognize types of connective tissue (e.g., dense irregular, dense regular, loose, adipose) and provide examples where different types of connective tissue are found in the body.
10. Recognize a basement membrane (or basal lamina) in sections or micrographs where the structure is conspicuously present and understand its functions.
