# FUNCTIONS OF LIVER

- Storage, metabolism and release of nutrients and some vitamins.
- Detoxification and elimination of toxins, drugs and metabolites.
- Synthesis of biologically important protein such as albumin, clotting factors, apolipoproteins.
- Synthesis and secretion of bile important for lipid digestion and absorption.
- Role in immune function and clearance of intestinally absorbed bacteria.

# Cellular Components of the Liver

- Hepatocytes
- Stellate or Ito Cells
- Kupfer Cells (macrophages)
- Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells
- Bile Ductular Epithelial Cells (Cholangiocytes)

# Components of Bile

Water ~ 1 liter/day
Bile Acids - major organic constituents
Phospholipids
Cholesterol
Bile pigments - bilirubin
Metabolites of Hormones, Drugs
Inorganic ions - $\mathrm{HCO}_3$ from duct cells

# Transport of Biliary Components by Hepatocytes

# MOLECULAR COMPONENTS OF BILE SECRETION

1. Uptake of bile salts by $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ coupled co-transporter (NTCP)
2. Basolateral membrane also contains several organic anion transport proteins (OATP)
3. Bile salts excreted into bile by the Bile Salt Export Protein (BSEP) an ATP binding cassette protein which belongs to multidrug resistance (MDR) gene family
4. Other apical proteins are MRP2 which transport a number of drugs, ABC 5/8 involved in cholesterol transport and MDR3 a phospholipid transporter (flipase)
5. Gene expression of many of above transporters is regulated by bile salts through the Bile Acid Receptor/ Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR)

# Function of Bile Ducts

1. Bile ducts are lined by cholangiocytes, columnar epithelial cells specialized to modify bile.
2. Ductules are freely permeable to water so bile rapidly becomes isotonic.
3. Ductules scavenge solutes such as glucose and amino acids that entered leaky canaliculus.
4. Cholangiocytes secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ in response to secretin (bile slightly alkaline)
5. Ductules secrete IgA molecules into bile

# BILE SALT SYNTHESIS

- Bile acids synthesized in the liver from cholesterol
- In the "classical pathway" the first and most important regulated step is 7α hydroxylation by 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1)
- Next 12α hydroxylation is followed by several steps leading to cholic acid
- The "alternative pathway" starts with initial formation of oxysterols and leads to chenodeoxycholic acid

# Primary Bile Acids

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
Cholic acid (3 OH groups)

Chenodeoxycholic acid (2 OH groups)

# Secondary Bile Acids

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)
Deoxycholic acid (2 OH groups)

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)
Lithocholic acid (1 OH group)

# Bile Acid Conjugation

Conjugation lowers the pKa so bile acids exist in the more soluble dissociated form

# GALLBLADDER FUNCTION

- The gallbladder concentrates bile and stores much of the bodies bile salt pool during fasting
- Epithelia absorbs Na⁺, Cl⁻ and H₂O
- Isotonicity maintained as a result of micelles having minimal osmotic activity
- Postprandially the gallbladder contracts in response to CCK (cholecystokinin)

# The Liver Synthesizes a Variety of Plasma Proteins

Major Plasma Proteins
Albumin, α fetoprotein, α₂-Microglobulin

Hemostasis Proteins
Fibrinogen, clotting factors and inhibitors
Plasmin (fibrinolysis)
Complement C3

Binding Proteins
Ceruloplasmin (copper)
Steroid binding proteins
Thyroid hormone binding globulin (TBG)
Transferrin

Prohormones
Angiotensinogen

Apolipoproteins
Apo A-I, -II, and IV
Apo B-100
Apo D, Apo E

# THE LIVER METABOLIZES AND EXCRETES FOREIGN MOLECULES (Drugs, Xenobiotics)

1. Most often involves oxidation (hydroxylation) and/or conjugation
2. Most hydroxylation is by family of enzymes termed cytochromes P450
a. Now usually referred to as CYPs. Three main gene families CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3
b. Genetic and nongenetic factors influence P450 activity
3. Conjugation is by UDP glucuronyltransferases (glucuronic acid), glutathione S-Transferase (glutathione) and sulfotransferases (sulfate)
4. Metabolites which are more water soluble are secreted into bile or plasma where can be excreted by kidney.
