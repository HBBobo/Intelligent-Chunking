# SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

## NORMAL SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

- Embryo has bisexual potential, each gonad can develop into either testis or ovary
- Orderly sequence needed for normal sexual differentiation of gonads, internal ductal system, and external genitalia
- Psychosocial issues in intersex disorders may have more serious ramifications than physical ambiguity and sterility → delivering child with ambiguous genitalia should be considered medical emergency
- Differences between male and female fetuses:
- Testicular determinant genes must be present and active for testicular development to begin; ovarian determinant genes must be present at later stages → absence of testicular determinants, ovarian development will begin regardless of genetic sex of embryo
- Male sexual differentiation depends on endocrine function of testes (testosterone, DHT, and MIS); female internal and external genital development occurs in absence of ovarian hormones
- Note: Mullerian female; Wolffian male

## MALE SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

- Initial switch seems to be Y-chromosome SRY gene
- Primordial germ cells travel to genital ridge, become enveloped by developing seminiferous tubules
- Sertoli cells at base of seminiferous tubules
- Sertoli cells produce MIS (Mullerian inhibiting substance) → arrest of development of Mullerian system
- Leydig cells appear and produce androgens
- DHT has significantly greater potency than testosterone
- Wolffian development due to testosterone because no 5-alpha-reductase to convert to DHT
- External genital masculinization due to DHT (5-alpha-reductase present)
- Competent androgen receptor needed for masculinization
- Mullerian and Wolffian systems are local and unilateral
- Remove one testis, that side develops Mullerian
- External genital development begins week 9, completed in early middle trimester
- Testicular descent week 32, gubernaculums "pulls" testis toward scrotum

## FEMALE SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

- Ovarian development begins in absence of testicular or ovarian determinant genes
- Mullerian development begins and continues unless arrested by MIS
- External genitalia will feminize in absence of androgens
- Ovaries contain 6 million germ cells by 20 weeks

IN SUMMARY
NORMAL &amp; ABNORMAL SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION
HST 071

# DELETION SYNDROMES

- Turner's syndrome: X-chromosome deletion, 45X
- Missing important ovarian determinant genes necessary for preservation of ovarian follicles
- Bilateral streak gonads
- Normal Mullerian and external genital development
- Associated with coarctation of aorta and horseshoe kidney
- 46XY gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer's syndrome):
- phenotypically normal female, delayed puberty, taller

# MULLERIAN INHIBITING SUBSTANCE DEFICIENCY

- Testicular development and androgen production otherwise normal, normal penile development
- Phenotypic males with uni- or bilateral cryptorchidism, testis contains Mullerian elements
- Sterility may result
- Agonadia (testicular regression syndrome):
- 46XY, phenotypic female, normal MIS
- blind vaginal pouch, absent internal genitalia and gonads = "empty pelvis syndrome"
- defect in sexual differentiation after MIS elaboration, androgens not produced
- likely environmental insult or vascular accident

# DEFECTS IN ANDROGEN BIOSYNTHESIS

- 46XY, normal TDF (testicular determining factor) genes and MIS expression → normal testes, Mullerian regression
- Steroid enzyme deficiency → suboptimal testosterone or DHT
- Wolffian system development stimulated by testosterone
- External genitalia depends on 5α-reductase and androgen receptor stimulation by DHT
- → under masculinization and ambiguity
- Sex of rearing usually female
- 5α-reductase deficiency: female sex of rearing at birth, then masculinization at puberty because of high testosterone
- 17α-hydroxylase deficiency may develop gynecomastia because of conversion of weak androgens to estrogen

# ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY SYNDROME

- Normal TDF genes, testicular development, MIS production, Mullerian regression, testicular androgen biosynthesis
- Androgen receptor defect prevent end-organ masculinization in utero and at puberty
- Mutation of X-located androgen receptor gene
- Resistance to androgens → absent masculinization, vaginal pouch, spontaneous breast development at puberty, diminished pubic hair
- Large breasts because no androgens to limit breast size
- Tall stature

# TRUE HERMAPHRODITISM

- Usually 46XX, less frequency 46XX/46XY (chimera), rarely 46XY
- Usually unilateral ovary and contralateral testes
- Chimera has two or more cells lines originating from different embryos
- Ovarian component more developed
- External genitalia under masculinized, breast development and menstruation common, should be raised as female

# SEX-REVERSED MALE

- 46XX with Y DNA sequences translocated to X chromosome

64

IN SUMMARY
HST 071
NORMAL &amp; ABNORMAL SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

- Translocation of SKY, not genes controlling sperm production
- Male phenotype, infertile

## CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA

- Most common and serious abnormality of sexual differentiation, seen in 46XX
- Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase or (less commonly) 11b-hydroxylase or 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
- Cortisol production limited → ACTH overproduction → accumulation of cortisol precursor and androgens
- High fetal adrenal androgens adversely influence external genitalia in female but not male fetuses → virilization
- Ranges from clitoromegaly and mild labioscrotal fusion through hypospadias
- Bilateral undescended gonads with ambiguous penile development, think CAH
- Tall children, short adults because of premature epiphyseal fusion
- Skin hyperpigmentation because of high melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH)
- 21-OH deficiency:
- Salt wasting and simple virilization
- Males infants more likely to be undiagnosed and develop salt-wasting crisis than females, because normal phenotype at birth

## ANDROGEN EXCESS SYNDROME

- In utero exposure to endogenous maternal or exogenous androgens can cause masculinization of the external genitalia
- Placenta can aromatize native androgens, except DHT, to estrogen and prevent masculinization
- Luteoma of pregnancy: androgen producing tumor

## IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF INTERSEX DISORDERS

- Sex of rearing = label of male or female given at birth
- Gender identity = one's own feelings of sexuality
- Ambiguous genitalia caused by intersex disorder may include: minimal clitoromegaly, isolated cryptorchidism, hypospadias, overt ambiguity
- If gender is in question, best to withhold decision on sex of rearing
- Can say "sexual development of this infant is incomplete; after a few studies it will be easy to determine whether the baby is a boy or girl"
