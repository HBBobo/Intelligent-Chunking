# FUNCTIONS OF STOMACH

1. Storage of ingested meal
2. Regulate rate of emptying into small intestine
3. Mix contents of stomach
4. Mechanical and Chemical Breakdown of food
5. Inhibit bacterial growth
6. Provide intrinsic factor for vitamin B₁₂ absorption

# INTEGRATED CONTROL OF GASTRIC ACID SECRETION BY NEURAL AND HUMORAL PATHWAYS

1. Vagus acts directly on parietal cells and indirectly by effects on gastrin and histamine release.
2. Histamine released from enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells) reaches parietal cells by local diffusion.
3. Gastrin released from antral G cells reaches parietal cells by systemic circulation.
4. Inhibitory regulators include somatostatin released from D cells in antrum and body of stomach and intestinal hormones collectively termed “enterogastrone”, and prostaglandins from surface cells.

# Gastric Antrum Lumen

Amino Acids, Digested Protein

Luminal Acid

![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)

© PD-2NEL Source Undetermined

Gastrin release from G cells of the antrum is stimulated by luminal amino acids and digested proteins and is inhibited in a paracrine fashion by somatostatin in response to luminal acid. Somatostatin is released when pH is &lt; 3.0

# METHODS FOR MEASURING ACID SECRETION

1. Gastric Aspiration
2. Intragastric Titration
3. Basal vs. Peak Acid Output

# PEPSIN

1. Proteolytic enzyme secreted by chief cells as an inactive precursor, pepsinogen.
2. Release stimulated by vagal nerve and by presence of acid in stomach.
3. Activated by peptide cleavage at acid pH.
4. Initiates digestion of protein. It is an endopeptidase and active at acid pH

# Intrinsic Factor

1. Glycoprotein of Mol. Wt. 55,000 which binds Vitamin B₁₂ (cobalmin).
3. Produced by parietal cells.
4. After binding B₁₂ it binds receptors on ileal absorptive cells and is internalized by endocytosis.
4. Absent in pernicious anemia.
