## INDIGESTIBLE CARBOHYDRATES

# DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES (cont)

- Normal American diet contains 200-300 g (50% of caloric intake)
- Serves an energy and carbon source
- Digestion includes a luminal phase and a brush border phase
- Only monosaccharides are appreciably absorbed

# Luminal Phase of Carbohydrate Digestion

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

- Amylase (pH optima 7) cleaves interior α1-4 linkages but not α1-6
- Endproduct is a mixture of maltose, maltotriose and limit dextrans
- Acarbose – Amylase inhibitor

## Intestinal Brush Border Hydrolysis of Oligosaccharides

|  Enzyme | Substrates | Molecular Site of Hydrolysis | Products  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Maltase | Maltose, maltotriose | α-1,4 linkage | glucose  |
|  Sucrase* | Sucrose | α-1,4 linkage | glucose, fructose  |

|  α-Dextrinase (isomaltase) | α-Limit dextrins | α-1,6 linkage | glucose, maltose, oligosaccharides  |

*Sucrase is also very active against maltose and maltotriose.

Lactase is present in infancy by disappears to a variable extent during childhood in most humans.

Exception is Northern Europeans and European Americans-commonly retain lactase into adulthood.

# DIETARY PROTEIN

- Normal humans require about 0.75 g/kg body weight of high quality dietary protein daily
- Nine essential amino acids are not synthesized and must be obtained from diet
- Normal American diet contains 70-90 g/day

Also endogenous protein in digestive secretions and shed epithelial cells

# DIETARY PROTEIN (cont)

- Digestion includes a luminal and brush border phase
- Both amino acids and di- and tri-peptides absorbed
- Digestion normally quite complete

# Activation of Pancreatic Proteolytic Enzymes

# Defects in Absorption of Protein Digestion
## Products due to Altered Transport Systems in Gut and Kidney

- Cystinuria
- Autosomal Recessive
- Increased excretion in urine with renal stones

- Hartnup Disease
- Autosomal Recessive
- Impaired absorption of neutral amino acids
- Symptoms of Niacin deficiency (Pellagra)

Patients normally don't show protein malnutrition- di and tri peptides sufficient

# DIETARY LIPID

- Normal American diet about 100g/day primarily as triglyceride
- Long chain "essential" polyunsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and fat soluble vitamins also present
- Lipid digestion begins in stomach and is completed in upper intestine in the lumen
- Multiple lipase enzymes have pH optima between 6 and 7

# STEPS IN LIPID DIGESTION

1. Emulsification
physical process takes place in stomach
phospholipids, proteins facilitate

2. Digestion
stomach and duodenum

3. Solubilization
requires bile salts
role of mixed micelles

4. Absorption
normally &lt;5gm in stool- more is “steatorrhea”

# Action of Major Pancreatic Lipases

pH optimum 6-7
in presence of bile salts acid inactivates

# Medium Chain Triglycerides

1. Fatty acids are 6-12 carbons in chain length
2. Present in small amounts in normal diet
3. Can be digested and absorbed without bile salts due to increased water solubility
4. Fatty acids not reesterified but taken up into the portal vein

# Cholesterol Absorption

- Luminal cholesterol comes largely from diet and bile; about 50% absorbed by intestine
- Cholesterol absorbed selectively as compared to plant sterols
- Absorbed cholesterol released in chylomicron and goes back to liver as chylomicron remnants
- Ezetimibe (Zetia) is a new drug that blocks cholesterol entry into the enterocyte

# CALCIUM ABSORPTION

1. Dietary intake about 1000 mg/day with net absorption of about 100 mg/day
2. Most active in duodenum and involves an energy dependent, transcellular pathway
3. Regulated by active form of Vit D, 1,25(OH)₂ Vit D, also known as 1,25(OH)₂-cholecalciferol

# Mechanism of Intestinal Calcium Absorption

# MOLECULAR COMPONENTS OF INTESTINAL CALCIUM ABSORPTION

1. Entry across the apical brush border is mediated by a specific $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ entry channel known as CaT1
2. Within the enterocyte a calcium binding protein, calbindin binds and transports $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$
3. $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ exit across the basolateral membrane is mediated by the plasma membrane $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ATPase, PMCA1

# DUODENAL FLUID DYNAMICS

- Mucosa is leaky allowing rapid osmotic equilibration of hypertonic and hypotonic meals
- Duodenal secretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_3^-$ from Brunner's glands
- Absorption by small intestine is then isotonic
