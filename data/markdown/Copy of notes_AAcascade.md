# Arachidonic Acid Metabolites and Inflammation

Tuesday, February 12, 2008
10:00 AM

- Arachidonic Acid can be produced two ways
- Via PLA to make lysophospholipid and arachidonic acid
- Via PLC to make DAG and phosphoryl-R then DAG lipase to make arachidonic acid and monacylglycerol
- Lipoxygenase pathway --&gt; leukotrienes
- LTB4 - neutrophils
- C4, D4, E4 - mast cells
- Glutathione-S transferase: C --&gt; D
- Cyclooxygenase pathway --&gt; prostaglandins
- PGI2 - prostacyclin
- PGE2 - macrophages
- Thromboxanes
- Cell Specificity of Arachidonic Acid Derivatives
- Neutrophils --&gt; leukotrienes
- M'phage/Monocyte --&gt; PG and leukotrienes
- Platelets --&gt; Thromboxanes
- Endothelial cells --&gt; prostacyclin (PGI2)
- Balances btwn prostacyclin and thromboxanes
- Biological Functions of Arachidonic Acid Products
- COX-derived products
- PGE2/PGI2
- Immunoregulatory
- Inhibits immune cell activaiton
- Inhibits cytokine production
- Inhibits mast cell activation
- Blocks platelet aggregation
- Increases vasodilation
- Stimulates adenylate cyclase
- Thromboxanes
- Causes vasoconstriction
- Induces platelet aggregation
- Lipoxygenase derived products
- LTB4
- Neutrophil activation
- Chemotaxis
- Degranulation
- Mast cell activation: degranulation
- LTC,D,E
- Smooth muscle contraction
- Increased vascular permeability
- In vivo effects
- Regulates thermostatic set point (fever)
- Activated leukocytes --&gt;
- Endogenous pyrogens
- Arachidonic acid in hypothalamus converted to PGE2 (NSAIDs inhibit)
- Leads to increased temperature
- Vasomotor tone and sweating
- Shivering

○ Regulates pain (PGE2 interacts w/ pain receptors)
○ Regulates blood flow
○ Regulates leukocyte activity
○ Rheumatoid arthritis
- Altered IgG leads to fixation/activation of complements
- Chemotaxis
- Lysosomal enzymes and activated oxygen released
- Collegenase, proteases, phospholipases destroy cartilage
- Phospholipases releases arachidonic acid from membranes --&gt; PG --&gt; nerve sensitization and vasodilation

- Pharmacologic Regulation
○ Modulate PLA/C activity
- Suppress the release of arachidonic acid (no substrate available)
- Blocks both COX and LO-derived products
○ Modulate COX activity
- Blocks COX-derived products
- COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors
- COX-1 constitutive activity
- PGE2 in kidneys
- Thromboxane A2 in platelets
- PGI2 in gastric cells for protection
- COX-2 inducible
- Pro-inflammatory PGs and other mediators lead to
- Inflammation
○ Modulate specific enzymes down-stream from COX
- Thromboxane synthetase inhibitors
○ Modulate LO activity
- Block 5-LO activity
- Small molecule receptor antagonists for cysteinyl leukotrienes

- NSAIDs
○ Aspirin, IB, indomethacin, acetaminophen
○ COX-2 Inhibitors
- coxibs
- Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid, primary dysmenorrhea, pain mgmt
○ Aspirin
- Irreversible inhibition of COX by acetylation at active site
- But b/c platelets don't reproduce and endothelial cells can make more COX, aspirin has an anti-thrombotic month --&gt; reduced risk of heart attack/stroke
- Aspiring inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking platelet thromboxane production
- Blocks platelet COX for life of platelet b/c no new protein synthesis occurs
- Can block endothelial cell-derived prostacyclin, but short-lived by cell produces new COX
- Platelet activity blocked more than endothelial cell activity
○ Indomethacin, ibuprofen reversibly inhibit COX

- Lipid mediators of inflammation
○ COX1+2 --&gt; prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2)
○ COX-1: thromboxanes
○ 5-LO: LTB4, C4, D4
○ Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, control of platelet aggregation, chemotaxis, pain, fever
○ Balance between
- Endothelium COX-2 --&gt; PGI2 --&gt; anti-thrombotic
- Platelets COX-1 --&gt; TXB2 --&gt; pro-thrombotic

- NSAIDs inhibits both, COXIBs inhibit COX-2
- Ibuprofen reversibly inhibits both leading to a balance, maybe a little anti-thrombotic
- COX-2 (vioxx) inhibits COX-2 favoring thrombosis --&gt; cardiogenic effects and why vioxx was pulled
- Aspirin irreversibly inhibits both, but as discussed before, COX-2 is truly irreversible vs. COX-1 being produced by endothelial cells --&gt; anti-thrombotic effects of aspirin
