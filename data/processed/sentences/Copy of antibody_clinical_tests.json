    "Monday, February 11, 2008 11:00 AM",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Isotype: antigenic determinant on an immunoglobulin that is expressed by all members of a species",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Inject a rabbit w/ a human immunoglobulin, determinants on constant region of the human antibody will be recognized as foreign",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Rabbit will make antibodies against them",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Rabbit antibodies recognize isotypic determinants and will react w/ Ig in the serum of virtually all humans",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Idiotype: antigenic determinant unique to a given Ig",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Used to describe complementarity determining regions to a given antibody",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Unique shape of epitope combining site made by the combination of the VH and VL hypervariable regions",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Many clinical tests use antibodies detect various proteins",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Affinity is dissociation constant for the single interaction w/ single Fab (impractical, unmeasurable)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Avidity is interaction of multivalent antigen w/ multivalent antibody",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Immunoelectrophoresis",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Separation of proteins by charge",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Place serum from patient in one well, serum from normal individual in other well in middle of plate",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Turn on electric field and separate charged proteins",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Drop appropriate rabbit anti-human antisera from trough toward lane of fractionated serum proteins",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Antibodies in human serum detected as arcs of precipitation (where antigen=antibody)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Agglutination",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Combine antigen w/ known antibodies and look for reaction",
    "[LIST_ITEM] A type blood w/ anti-A antibodies = reaction",
    "[LIST_ITEM] B + anti-A antibodies = no reaction",
    "[LIST_ITEM] ELISA",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Coat well w/ antibody anti-insulin epitope 1",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Introduce sample, if insulin present, it will bind to antibodies",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Wash off unbound material",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Add anti-insulin-alkaline phosphatase epitope 2",
    "[LIST_ITEM] If DNP changes from colorless --&gt; yellow, insulin is present",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Radioimmunoassays",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Use radiolabeled antigens or antibodies as competitive assay",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Clinical samples are used to compete for binding to antibodies w/ constant amount of radiolabeled standard",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Standard curve helps determine amount bound",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Results reported as positive/negative (50% bound is normal)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Quantitites based on standard curve",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Titers (positive at dilution of 1:250, but not at 1:500)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Amount of antibody against a particular pathogen should be zero or low in an individual who has never experienced that pathogen",
    "[LIST_ITEM] After recovery, amount in serum should be higher",
    "[LIST_ITEM] At height of infection, since not in effector phase, antibody in serum should be low",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Compare serum from patient tin active infection vs. convalescent serum",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Pathogen-specific antibody titers elevated when pt. is first seen w/ subacute/chronic infection or one w/ long incubation period",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Monoclonal Antibodies",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Mixture of serum antibodies in conventional (animal) antiserum is not perfect",
    "Lecture Page 4",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Serum is a mixture of antibodies that represents all antigens ever encountered",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Each antigen w/ many epitopes results in the production of many antibodies in serum",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Some antibodies bind to antigen w/ low affinity, may bind related antigen w/ low affinity",
    "○ Monoclonal antibodies solve most of the problems inherent in conventional antisera",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Spleen cells from mouse immunized w/ antigen A",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Myeloma cells lacking antibody secretion and HGPRT (makes cell susceptible to death by aminopterin)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Spleen and myeloma cells fuse with PEG",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Transferred to HAT medium w/ aminopterin and immortal hybridomas proliferate",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Select hybridomas make antibody specific for antigen A",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Clone selected hybridomas",
    "○ Supernatant of each hybridoma can be screened via ELISA for secretion of particular antibody ○ Advantages: immortal, monoclonal (specific), grown in large quantities ○ Uses: reagents for sandwich ELISA, detection of bacterial/viral antigens, tissue typing or analysis of CD expression, detection of virtually any protein",
