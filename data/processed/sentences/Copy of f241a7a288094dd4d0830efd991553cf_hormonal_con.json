    "[H2] HISTORY.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] In 1938, a gram of natural cortisone was worth $100 (1938 dollars!)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] For many years ethnobotanists had known that certain plants had been used by primitive peoples as fish poisons, soaps, and shampoos",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Produce foam in water and are called saponins, which are steroids",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Saponin destroys red blood cells on contact",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Causes the fish to be stunned and then float to the surface",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Fish are not poisonous to humans when eaten.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Some of these saponin-bearing plants were also used by societies as oral contraceptives",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Mexico and Central America, several plants were taken to stop female ovulation",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Matto Grosso Indian women in Brazil took plant products daily to prevent pregnancy",
    "[LIST_ITEM] A company called Syntex was then organized to make steroids from Mexican yams, using the syntheses invented by Marker",
    "[LIST_ITEM] About 66 pounds of fresh yams could yield one pound of diosgenin and two ounces of cortisone",
    "[LIST_ITEM] In the 1960s, a gram of cortisone cost two dollars to produce",

    "[LIST_ITEM] Inactive when given orally",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Ethinyl group at 17 position made it orally active (EE)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Older pills had used 3-methyl ester (mestranol) of ethinyl estradiol",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Mestranol will not bind to receptor and must be converted to EE",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Currently used compound is EE",
    "[H2] PHARMACOLOGY OF STEROID COMPOUNDS.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Metabolism of EE",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Varies from person to person",

    "[LIST_ITEM] Thrombosis is related to estrogen dose",
    "[H2] PHARMACOLOGY OF STEROID COMPOUNDS.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Success of EE led to development of ethisterone (oral derivative of testosterone)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Removal of 19 carbon from ethisterone to form norethindrone",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Changed properties from androgenic to progestogenic",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Progestational derivatives of testosterone are referred to 19-nortestosterone",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Androgenic properties not totally eliminated",
    "[H2] PHARMACOLOGY OF STEROID COMPOUNDS.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Norethindrone can be converted to EE in small amounts",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Also has very weak binding to estrogen receptor",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Serious side effects related to high dose of progestational agents now minimal",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Another compound (Norgestrel) is racemic mixture of d- and l- norgestrel (only d-norgestrel is active)",
    "IN SUMMARY HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION",
    "[H2] Northehindrone Family.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Norethindrone",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Norethynodrel",

    "[LIST_ITEM] Lynestrenol",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Norgestrel",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Norgestimate",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Desogestrel",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Gestodene",
    "[H2] Desogestrel &amp; Norgestimate.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Two degradative steps before it expresses progestational properties",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Active metabolite is 3-keto-desogestrel",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Differs from levonogestrel by a methylene group in 11 position",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Several metabolites contribute to norgestimate activity",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Considered a second generation progestational agent because of metabolite (levonorgestrel)",
    "[H2] Definitions of Dose.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Low-Dose Oral Contraceptives",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Product containing &lt;50 ug EE",
    "[LIST_ITEM] First Generation Oral Contraceptives",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Products containing 50ug or more EE",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Second Generation Oral Contraceptives",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Products containing levonorgestrel, norgestimate and other norethindrone family and 30 or 35 ug EE",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Third Generation Oral Contraceptives",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Product containing desogestrel or gestodene with 20 or 30 ug EE",
    "[H2] Potency.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Historically used",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Different responses",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Uterus",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Breast",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Liver",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Animal and human responses differ",

    "[LIST_ITEM] (actually due to coagulation facilitation by estrogen)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] New Progestins",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Desogestrel",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Gestoden",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Norgestimate",
    "[LIST_ITEM] All are comparable to old products",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Cycle control, bleeding, amenorrhea",
    "[LIST_ITEM] They produce increased SHBG",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Reduced free testosterone",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Use for acne and hirsuitism",
    "IN SUMMARY HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION",
    "Formulations ☐ Attempt to reduce side effects, BTB ☐ No real difference noted over monophasic ☐ 7 day pill free ☐ 4 days pill free ☐ 2 days pill free ☐ Estrophasic approach – low early estrogen",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Reduced nausea initially",
    "[LIST_ITEM] As estrogen rises the SHBG rises",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Reduced androgenic effects",
    "Mechanism of Action ☐ Combined pill is given daily for 3 weeks of 4 ☐ Prevents ovulation",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Pituitary",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Hypothalamic ☐ Progestational effect suppresses LH (no surge) ☐ Estrogenic effect suppresses FSH (no dominant follicle) ☐ Even if follicle developed there would be sufficient inhibition to prevent ovulation (minipill) ☐ Purpose of the estrogenic component",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Stability to the endometrium ☐ Prevent irregular shedding (breakthrough bleeding)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Potentiates the action of progesterone ☐ Allowed reduction in dose of progestational agents ☐ Probably increases intracellular expression of P receptors ☐ Minimal level of estrogen is required to maintain efficacy of combined pill",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Effect of progesterone always exceeds that of estrogen ☐ Endometrium (decidualized, exhausted glands) ☐ Cervical mucous (thick and impervious to sperm) ☐ Tubal function (? Reduction in motility – alteration in tubal fluid)",
    "Efficacy of Oral Contraceptives ☐ Most failures occur because of delay in initiation of next cycle ☐ Allow escape ovulation ☐ Use of placebo pills to avoid “forgetting to restart” is a good idea ☐ Most prevalent problem associated with failure ☐ Vomiting ☐ Diarrhea ☐ Use backup method after bout of gastroenteritis",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Place pill in vagina ☐ .1% failure rate if motivated, 7.6% during first year",
