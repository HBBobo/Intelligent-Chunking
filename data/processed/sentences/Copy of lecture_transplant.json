    "[H1] ABO Matching.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] ABO antigens are expressed on the vascular endothelium, hence it is important to ABO match when transplanting a vascularized organ",
    "[LIST_ITEM] ABO mismatching leads to endothelial damage by ABO antibodies with subsequent widespread thrombosis and graft loss",
    "[H1] Review of ABO Reactions.",
    "Individual with blood group O make antibodies against type A and type B antigens, and so cannot accept grafts that are either type A, type B, or type AB.",
    "Individuals with blood group A make antibodies against type B antigens, and so cannot accept grafts that are type B or AB.",
    "The reciprocal is true for individuals with blood group type B.",
    "Individuals with blood group type AB do not make antibodies to either type A or type B antigens, and so can accept grafts from anyone.",
    "Hyperacute rejection (within hours) is usually antibody mediated, most often by antibodies against A and B blood group antigens.",
    "Both acute (days) and chronic (months) rejection are mediated by T cells.",
    "Acute rejection.",
    "The interstitium is diffusely expanded by an inflammatory infiltrate composed predominantly of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes, monocytes).",
    "T cells mediate graft rejection and the HLA molecules encoded in the MHC are most important in the T cell immune response to a graft.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Syngeneic grafts (where the donor and recipient are genetically identical) will not be rejected",
    "[LIST_ITEM] If donor/recipient HLA antigens are not identical, T cells will react against foreign HLA molecules",
    "[LIST_ITEM] HLA matching reduces the chance of acute rejection",
    "[LIST_ITEM] HLA-identical siblings are optimal",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Post-transplant immunosuppression is needed for all transplant pairs except identical twins",
    "[H1] Minor Histocompatibility Antigens.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Minor histocompatibility antigens are self proteins that are loaded into the HLA peptide groove",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Even when HLA antigens are identical, differences in the self peptides derived from the donor organ can facilitate an immune response",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Thus, whenever there are genetic differences between the donor graft and the recipient T cells, an alloreaction can occur",
    "Matching transplant donors and recipients for MHC molecules is sufficient, even though minor histocompatibility antigens are not matched.",
    "T cells clones recognizing allogeneic MHC molecules are abundant, and thus the transplantation reaction is vigorous.",
    "It can be controlled by immunosuppression, but with difficulty.",
    "The better matched the donor and recipient are for both MHC class I and class II molecules, the fewer T cell clones that will respond and the more likely it will be the immunosuppressive drugs will be successful.",
    "T cell clones recognizing allogeneic minor histocompatibility antigens are much less abundant, and hence the transplantation reaction is less vigorous.",
    "Immune responses to minor histocompatibility antigens are usually well-controlled by immunosuppressive drugs.",
    "[H1] Immunosuppression.",
    "To prevent both acute and chronic rejection, all recipients of solid organ transplants (except those between identical twins) must receive some combination of immunosuppressive drugs upon transplantation.",
    "Transplant recipients are at great risk for infections due to this immunosuppression.",
    "Even though the kinds and amounts of immunosuppressive drugs can be slowly reduced, some must be used for the entire life of the transplant recipient.",
    "Thus, these individuals are always at greater risk for infections than are healthy, immunocompetent individuals.",
    "Immunosuppressive drugs can act in at least four different ways to suppress immune reactivity:",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) include aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, naproxen, and others. As discussed by Dr. Kunkel in his lecture, these reduce inflammation by inhibiting enzymes important in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Corticosteroids (prednisone, for example) inhibit the antigen-driven differentiation of T cells and other immune cells. Corticosteroids do this by inhibiting the expression of many different genes, some of which are important in the activation of T cells. Corticosteroids also lead to apoptosis of activated T cells. These compounds suppress the action of inflammatory cells by reducing both prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis and by inhibiting emigration of leukocytes from blood vessels (see Dr. Stoolman’s lecture). However, corticosteroids also have numerous side effects, including fluid retention, weight gain, diabetes, bone mineral loss, and thinning of the skin. These side effects are also a consequence of the ability of corticosteroids to alter gene expression.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Anti-metabolic drugs (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, and others) act by killing all dividing cells. Typically, these are nucleoside analogs that inhibit cell division by inhibiting nucleotide synthesis or by alkylating DNA. Thus, they act by killing T cells and B cells that are undergoing antigen-driven differentiation. Since the antigen-specific clones are eliminated as they are activated, this inhibits anti-transplant or autoimmune responses. However, all immune responses are inhibited, so the patient is also generally immunosuppressed, and thus susceptible to infection. Other side effects involve other cells with a high rate of division: bone marrow stem cells, the skin, hair follicles, epithelial cells in the intestine, the fetus.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] The fourth group of immunosuppressive agents prevent the signaling that it is important to antigen-dependent T cell and B cell differentiation. These compounds bind to cytoplasmic proteins that prevent signal transduction from the T cell or immunoglobulin receptor via calcineurin (cyclosporin A and tacrolimus) or inhibit protein translation and progress through the cell cycle (rapamycin). Cyclosporin A and tacrolimus lead to a greatly reduced expression of T cell-derived cytokines; rapamycin leads to T cell apoptosis. These agents are very effective inhibitors of antigen-driven immune responses. However, their principle side effect, general immunosuppression, is a direct consequence of this ability to inhibit immune responses.",
    "Most commonly, two or three different immunosuppressive drugs are used to prevent transplant rejection or to improve rheumatologic diseases or allergic diseases.",
    "By using smaller amounts of each drug, and by using drugs from more than one of the four groups of immunosuppressive agents, inhibition of immune responses can be improved, while avoiding some of the side effects on other organ systems.",
    "However, general immunosuppression cannot be avoided, and so patients on immunosuppressive drugs are always at risk for opportunistic infections by bacteria, viruses, and fungi.",
    "There are three ways to match donors and recipients for histocompatibility antigens.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Type for MHC molecules expressed on leukocytes using antibodies. This is the original method used. Antibodies specific for a single allele of one MHC gene are difficult to obtain, and many alleles (especially those encoded by class II genes) can not be typed with antibodies.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Type for MHC genes by PCR amplification and sequencing. This has the advantage of finding all potential differences at the MHC, but is expensive and takes more time than typing with antibodies. If time is not a factor, this is the method of choice.",
    "A third way to test for a match of transplantation antigens is a “Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction” (MLR--review Parham, pg. 123).",
    "An MLR is a co-culture of lymphocytes from two different individuals",
    "The MLR detects the ability of T lymphocytes to recognize allogeneic differences on white blood cells from another individual.",
    "After recognizing the differences, the T cells divide.",
    "This cell division can be measured by uptake of tritiated thymidine from the culture media into the cells.",
    "Lymphocytes from individual “A” mixed with lymphocytes from individual “B”: T cells from each individual recognize transplantation antigens on the other individuals lymphocytes as foreign, and begin to undergo cell division in the activation phase of the immune response.",
    "PD-ENEL",
    "University of Michigan Department of Microbiology and Immunology",
    "A negative control for the MLR is the potential graft recipients lymphocytes reacting to his or her own x-irradiated lymphocytes.",
    "Since there is no “foreignness” in this combination, the amount of cell division measured by uptake of a DNA precursor, tritiated thymidine, is the background level.",
    "The test combination is the recipient’s lymphocytes (“Responders”) reacting to a potential donor’s x-irradiated lymphocytes (“Stimulators”).",
    "Since the donor’s lymphocytes are x-irradiated, they cannot divide.",
    "Hence, one measures the cell division resulting from a “one-way” recognition of the donor (graft) by the recipient (host).",
    "[H1] MLR that measures “One-way recognition”.",
    "PD-ENEL",
    "University of Michigan Department of Microbiology and Immunology",
    "[H1] Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR).",
    "Almost all of the cell division is the result of recognition of MHC-encoded differences.",
    "Most importantly, differences at class II, which are covered poorly by tissue typing tests, are the key differences that result in thymidine uptake.",
    "Thus, tritiated thymidine uptake in MLR is a very sensitive measure of immunological recognition between a potential donor and graft recipient.",
    "Since the same T lymphocytes that might eventually lead to graft rejection are the reagents used, availability of suitable reagents is not an issue.",
    "The mixed lymphocyte reaction takes about one week to complete, and it is expensive.",
    "It has the advantage of measuring the histocompatibility differences by a T cell mediated immune response.",
    "Thus, it estimates well the intensity of a transplantation reaction in vivo without using any specific reagents (antibodies).",
    "[H1] Bone Marrow Transplantation.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Bone marrow transplantation can be thought of as another type of organ transplant",
    "[LIST_ITEM] In the case of marrow transplantation, alloreactivity is not only in the direction of host versus donor graft, ie, rejection",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Alloreactivity also takes place in the direction of donor versus host, ie, graft-versus-host disease",
    "[H1] Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.",
    "Hematopoietic stem cells are effective after transplantation because the stem cells home to the bone marrow from the peripheral blood and a few stem cells can reconstitute all of the components of the bone marrow.",
    "Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is caused by mature T cells that contaminate the bone marrow or stem cell preparation.",
    "These donor T cells recognize the allogeneic MHC molecules of the host, or the minor histocompatibility antigens of the host, and initiate an inflammatory immune response against host tissue.",
    "[H1] Donor Selection Influences Risk of GVHD.",
    "In order of increasing differences at HLA, and therefore decreasing desirability for a bone marrow donor:",

    "[LIST_ITEM] Other family member",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Matched unrelated donor",
    "[LIST_ITEM] The probability that any two unrelated persons will match is extremely low",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Broad application of this technique is made feasible by large volunteer registries",
    "[H1] Conditioning Regimens.",
    "Recipients of bone marrow transplants invariably undergo a conditioning regimen with chemotherapy and/or radiation in order to:",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Reduce the tumor burden with cytotoxic drugs",
    "[LIST_ITEM] To immunosuppress the recipient to prevent rejection of the bone marrow transplant",

    "[LIST_ITEM] Toxicity from the conditioning regimen",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Short and long term effects",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Graft rejection",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Graft versus Host Disease",
    "[H1] Acute GVHD.",

    "Who would be the best kidney donor to the patient?",
    "The correct answer is \"B\".",
    "Since the patient and sibling 1 do not stimulate each other's T cells to divide in tissue culture (in both directions), they must be identical at the MHC, and must be very similar at many minor histocompatibility genes.",
