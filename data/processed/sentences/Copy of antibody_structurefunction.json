    "[LIST_ITEM] Antibody Structure",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Derived from monoclonal antibodies secreted by plasmacytomas",
    "[LIST_ITEM] All antibodies made of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Constant Region",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Located in carboxy part of chain",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Light chains: numbered 108-214, κ and λ",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Heavy chain: α, γ, δ, ε, μ",
    "[LIST_ITEM] γ1, 2, 3, 4",
    "[LIST_ITEM] α 1 and 2",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Subclasses have exactly same sequence",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Variable Region",
    "[LIST_ITEM] AA sequence in amino terminal part never the same for two immunoglobulins",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Light chain residues 1-107",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Variability = number of different amino acids at a residue/frequency of the most frequent amino acid",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Hypervariable regions w/in a variable region have variability from 15-100",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Hypervariable regions come together to form antigen binding site = complementarity determining region (CDR)",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Framework regions are clusters of amino acid residues btw HV regions w/ variability of 1-20; form scaffold upon which variable region is built",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Domains have 110 amino acid units with disulfide bridge btw two cysteines",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Folding of the Immunoglobulin",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Variable and constant regions fold the same and are independent of each other",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Parallel β-pleated sheets perpendicular to the cys-cys bond",
    "[LIST_ITEM] HV residues clustered near each other and form the antigen binding pocket",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Not every HV region contacts antigen",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Antibody Function",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Antibody Classes",
    "[LIST_ITEM] IgM: 4 constant region domains, 1.5 mg/ml in serum; fixes complement, opsinin",
    "[LIST_ITEM] IgG: 3 constant region domains, proline rich hinge, 13.5 mg/ml in serum; opsinin, some subclasses fix complement, some cross placenta",
    "[LIST_ITEM] IgA: 3 constant region domains, proline rich hinge; secreted at mucosal surface; only immunoglobulin that exits body",
    "[LIST_ITEM] IgE: 4 constant region domains; binds mast cells, allergies",
    "[LIST_ITEM] IgD: 3 constant region domains, proline rich hinge; cell surface only",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Individual immunoglobulin has either κ or γ light chain",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Opsinins are antibodies that enhance phagocytosis",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Hinge is 20-30 aa region that is proline rich",
    "[LIST_ITEM] IgA includes attached secretory piece which protects against proteolysis",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Not all secreted as individual molecules",
    "[LIST_ITEM] IgM secreted as pentamer w/ J chain in middle",
    "[LIST_ITEM] IgA secreted as dimers w/ J chain",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Fragments created by limited digestion of antibodies w/ proteolytic enzymes; each class or subclass of heavy chain has a different amino acid sequence and hence a different Fc region",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Different effector functions of different classes and subclasses of antibodies are mediated by binding to specific Fc receptors",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Fc(ε)RI on mast cells, eosinophils",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Poly Ig receptor on mucosal epithelia - IgA",
    "Lecture Page 2",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Fc(γ) receptor on macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Opsinins bind go IgG",
    "[LIST_ITEM] b/c each subclass has a different constant regions different Fc receptors bind different classes and subclasses of Ig",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Each subclass of Ig has specific set of effector fxns",
    "[LIST_ITEM] All antibodies can use same variable regions",
    "[LIST_ITEM] But with different constant regions, way pathogen is handled after binding is different for each subclass",
