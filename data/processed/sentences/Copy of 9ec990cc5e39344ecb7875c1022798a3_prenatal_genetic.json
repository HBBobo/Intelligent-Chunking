    "[LIST_ITEM] Increased nuchal skin alone, in the absence of other ultrasonographic dysmorphologic features, does not generally help to identify fetuses with other abnormal karyotypes.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] The nuchal thickness/humerus length ratio and maternal age had a 79.8% detection rate at a 22.1% false-positive rate, compared with maternal age plus humerus length (sensitivity, 55.1%) or maternal age plus nuchal thickness (sensitivity, 66.7%) at the same false-positive rate.
