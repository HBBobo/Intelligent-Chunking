    "The enteric nervous system, sometimes known as the \"little brain\" contains a similar number of neurons as the spinal cord and can function independent of the CNS.",
    "Morphologically its main components are the myenteric and submucosal plexus.",
    "It contains sensory or afferent neurons, interneurons, and motor or efferent neurons located within the bowel wall.",
    "Enteric neurons are organized into \"hardwired\" circuits that involve integration but can be modulated by the central nervous system through the autonomic nervous system, especially the Vagus nerve.",
    "PD-THEL Granger, D, et al. Clinical Gastrointestinal Physiology. W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA; 1985.",
    "Some reflexes occur entirely within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract.",
    "Note Myenteric Plexus provides main innervation of smooth muscle and the Submucosal Plexus provides primary innervation to the mucosa",

    "Vagovagal or long reflex: information from receptors in the smooth muscle or mucosa is relayed through the enteric nervous system to higher centers via vagal afferents.",

    "The Vagus provides the primary neural control of the GI tract.",
    "It contains afferent fibers with cell bodies in the Nodose ganglion which project to the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius of the brain stem.",
    "Vagal efferents have their cell bodies in the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus (DMV) in the adjacent brain stem.",
    "These motor fibers are small in number but powerful in effect and innervate the bulk of the gut as shown on Pages 15 and 17 as well as the heart and lungs.",
    "Visceral nocioceptive fibers (sensitive to stretch and chemical irritants) travel in sympathetic nerves and enter the spinal cord where it is projected to the brain-stem and viserotopically mapped but poorly localized, often resulting in referred pain.",
