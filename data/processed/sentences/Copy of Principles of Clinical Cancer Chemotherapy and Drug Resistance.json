    "HST-151",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Resistant cells have an impaired ability to accumulate and retain drug. Drug efflux is probably more efficient.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] An over-expressed plasma membrane glycoprotein, designated the P- or permeability glycoprotein, with a MW of 170,000 daltons, is consistently found in multidrug-resistant human and animal cell lines, and in transplantable tumors.",

    "[LIST_ITEM] Transfer of DNA from drug-resistant cells confers multidrug resistance and plasma membrane glycoprotein expression.",
    "[LIST_ITEM] Transfer of multidrug resistance with a cDNA coding for the P-glycoprotein demonstrates that overexpression of this single gene is sufficient to confer the resistance phenotype.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] The P-glycoprotein or MDR1 gene is a member of a small family of genes. Not all members of this family confer the multidrug-resistant phenotype, thus suggesting that there may be functionally distinct classes of P-glycoprotein isoforms.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Double minute chromosomes (DMs) and homogeneous staining regions (HSRs) are found in multidrug resistant lines. The degree of amplified DNA fragments correlates with the degree of drug resistance. The HSRs represent amplified P-glycoprotein genes and are reversible.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] The P-glycoprotein is comprised of 1280 amino acids with 12 hydrophobic segments that act as transmembrane domains. There are two similar domains with cytoplasmic sites that bind ATP. Both domains appear to be required for function. P-glycoprotein is primarily expressed on plasma membranes while smaller amounts have been detected in the ER and Golgi membranes.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Vinblastine photoaffinity analogs bind to the P-glycoprotein, and binding is competitively antagonized by unlabeled vinblastine and anthracycline. The vinblastine protein complex is precipitated by a monclonal antibody to the P-glycoprotein. Moreover, vinblastine is transported by an ATP-dependent process through membranes that contain P-glycoprotein. These findings have established that the P-glycoprotein is a transporter molecule.",
    "The P-glycoprotein is also homologous to bacterial transport proteins which are involved in ATP-dependent transport of specific molecules, particularly hemolysin, through the bacterial inner cell membrane.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] High levels of MDR1 gene expression have been found in liver, colon, small intestine, kidney, adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The P-glycoprotein is localized in a highly polar fashion on the bile canalicular surface of hepatocytes, the lumenal surface of the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, and on the lumenal mucosal",
    "HST-151",
    "surface of intestinal columnar cells.",
    "MDR1 RNA levels are usually high in those cancers derived from normal tissues which themselves have high MDR1 expression.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Intrinsic multidrug resistance appears to be related to persistent expression of a gene involved in normal cellular function. Similar biochemical changes occur in multidrug resistant human breast cancer cells and in rat hyperplastic liver nodules that develop resistance to a wide variety of hepatotoxins (Solt Farber model). Mechanisms of de novo resistance to therapy in tumors associated with increased carcinogen exposure (colon, lung cancer) may therefore be similar to those associated with acquired resistance to anti-neoplastic agents.",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Drugs such as verapamil, diltiazem and quinidine have been found to overcome multidrug resistance in cell culture and in some animal experiments. For example, verapamil has been used to reverse adriamycin resistance in human ovarian cancer cells. Verapamil competes with vinblastine for binding, suggesting that drug binding to the P-glycoprotein is a necessary step in the process of drug resistance. Other agents that reverse P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance include steroids and steroid antagonists (progesterone and tamoxifen) and reserpine. The most potent chemosensitizers are hydrophobic molecules with a basic nitrogen atom and two planar aromatic rings (termed the \"pharmacophore\").",
    "[NUMBERED_ITEM] Verapamil has been used clinically in an attempt to reverse multidrug resistance. A Phase I-II study failed to demonstrate a potentiation of doxorubicin therapy with verapamil in eight drug-resistant ovarian cancer patients. However, a more recent study has shown a therapeutic benefit for three of eight patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by adding a continuous infusion of verapamil to the VAD regimen. The three responding patients had P-glycoprotein positive tumors. Dose-limiting toxicity of verapamil was hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Myelosuppression was not increased in this trial. In this regard, in vitro studies have demonstrated that doxorubicin cytotoxicity is not increased by verapamil in normal human marrow cells. Other clinical studies are underway using amiodarone and quinidine as inhibitors of P-glycoprotein mediated resistance.",
    "[H2] E. Acquired Resistance to Alkylating Agents.",
    "Prolonged exposure of human cells to alkylating agents has resulted in a maximum of 10-15 fold resistance.",
    "This finding for alkylating agents is distinct from patterns of resistance seen with other chemotherapeutic agents.",
    "Alkylating agents therefore more closely resemble X-irradiation where significant resistance has not been demonstrated with repetitive treatment.",
